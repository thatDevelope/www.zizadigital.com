]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are over 92 million connected devices in Nigeria <em>(Source NCC)</em>. If you subtract those with multiple phones and possibly other devices like ATMs, we can safely say we have about 70million people who are connected in Nigeria.</p>
<p>All these people are on the internet for at least one of these reasons or sometimes, all three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>They want to be entertained</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>They want to be educated/informed</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>They want to engage</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these needs require content to drive it. Irrespective of the age or class of the consumer.</p>
<p>Today, digital content drives marketing which has largely moved online to meet consumers in their comfort zone.</p>
<p>Today’s consumer doesn’t want to be directly sold to. S/He wants to be educated/informed, entertained and engaged and if you are going to be successful at marketing anything to him/her, you have to develop content that is engaging, entertaining and/or educative/informative.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a Case Study of Digital Content in Marketing</strong>.</p>
<p>Segun needs a new laptop. He heads to google. He checks for the specifications of different laptops (probably a blog post or a video), he checks for reviews, then he checks prices and possible points of purchase. He asks for recommendations on Twitter or WhatsApp group and compares the recommendations with all the earlier information he gleaned earlier from Google. Then, he takes his decision long before he steps out of his house to make the actual purchase.</p>
<p>Segun has just been sold to – through the different types of contents that were strategically placed for him to consume to aid his buying decision.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that Google aggregates all the content on the web and delivers your specific needs using a filter called <strong>Search</strong>. In essence, the web will be a desert without content.</p>
<h5>What&#8217;s The Goal of Digital Content?</h5>
<p>In digital content creation, your goal isn’t to sell directly to prospects, your goal is to attract prospects, build trust and guide them through the buying stages.</p>
<p>All elements of Digital Marketing – Email Marketing, Search Marketing, Mobile Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Websites, Display Advertising – are driven by Content – albeit in different formats.</p>
<h5>To be successful in digital content creation, you need to look at 2 things:</h5>
<h5><strong>THE MESSAGE</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>THE MEDIUM</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Message</strong> – What message do I want to pass across? Who is my message going to? At what stage of the buyer’s journey is this person?</p>
<p><strong>The Medium</strong> – What medium will this message be on? What format will attract the target audience?</p>
<h5><strong>Here&#8217;s an example</strong></h5>
<p>If your target audience is a 17-year-old chap, you have no business creating an E-book for him to download on your website. He will never read it. Instead, you are better off reaching him with a one-minute video on Snapchat.  <strong>Message + Medium</strong></p>
<h5>Digital Content Formats</h5>
<p>Content can be presented in various formats:</p>
<p>Videos</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Infographics</p>
<p>Blog Posts</p>
<p>E-Books/Playbooks/Guides</p>
<p>Articles</p>
<p>White papers</p>
<p>Podcasts/Webcasts</p>
<p>Templates</p>
<p>Research Reports</p>
<p>Games e.t.c</p>
<h5>And there Is a new kid on the block &#8211;  Online Experience</h5>
<p>Online experience uses a mix of different formats to tell a story. Instead of just seeing static text on the screen for an article or perhaps an e-book, it can use a mix of Text, Videos, Infographics and images to tell a complete story.</p>
<h5>Here Are Some Online Experience Examples:</h5>
<p><a href="http://lnkd.in/TPlanExperience">http://lnkd.in/TPlanExperience</a></p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/NewMediaMessage">http://bit.ly/NewMediaMessage</a></p>
<p><a href="http://lnkd.in/SMSessions">http://lnkd.in/SMSessions</a> .</p>
<p>Facebook Carousel Ad is another good example of Online Experience</p>
<h5>Measuring The Effectiveness of Digital Content</h5>
<p>Now that you’ve got your message and medium right, your content has got to be <strong>measured</strong>.</p>
<p>You can use the following metrics:</p>
<p><strong>Lead Generation</strong> – How much data was the content able to bring in (Data Capture) – especially for B2B businesses</p>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong> – How much people engaged with the content by sharing, commenting etc. – Engagement helps top of mind awareness and word of mouth recommendation</p>
<p><strong>Sales</strong> – How much sales was the content able to influence? Businesses need to make sales. The numbers are important.</p>
<p>In some cases, one content may not be able to satisfy all three measurement criteria but nonetheless, it should satisfy at least one criteria – in line with the marketing objectives.</p>
<h5>Looking into the future</h5>
<p>All marketing professionals of today and indeed the future will need to be able to generate content. Gone are the days when you say, &#8220;I am not a copywriter&#8221;. Content creation is an important skill in marketing.</p>
<p>Your Facebook post, tweet, Instagram post, Whatsapp chat etc., are all content. You only need to be more purposeful when creating marketing content.</p>
<p>To help hone your content skill, I recommend the book &#8211; <a href="http://annhandley.com/everybodywrites/"><strong>Everybody Writes by Ann Handley</strong></a></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is one big marketplace with only one product on display; Content.</p>
<p>Without consistent doses of this, social media is as good as dead. In a marketplace, saturated with only one kind of product, variety is important for the survival of brands marketing their products and services on these platforms.</p>
<p>On social media, your content has to be creative, engaging, relevant and consistent.</p>
<p>This list will help you diversify your content formats making it easier to put up quality content consistently and also show you what platforms are best suited for each content type.</p>
<h5>1. Videos [Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, Vine]</h5>
<p>Videos are the rave of the moment right now, especially on Facebook. As long as you have a great brand story to tell, videos are your best bet for getting your message across effectively.</p>
<p>A good video will give your brand better engagement and CTRs and there are lots of tools online that let you make videos ranging from gifs to animations and full HD.</p>
<p>In addition to these types of videos, you can stream videos to a live audience on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter! In fact, Videos are certainly a great way to create content.</p>
<h5>2. Infographics [Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest]</h5>
<p>Infographics are a graphical representation of information. According to Content Desk, an infographic is 30 times more likely to be read than a pure text article.</p>
<p>This gives your content a different feel altogether, it displays all you need to discuss in one glance. It’s a very effective way of creating content for your social media pages because your readers are able to digest large information in small memorable chunks. Again, there are a lot of free tools for making great infographic and one of them is Canva. They are easy to use and work wonders for your social media engagement.</p>
<h5>3. Questionnaires or Quiz [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>There is no doubt that questionnaires and quizzes are an audience engagement magnet. They foster a conversation between a content creator and a content consumer (Which is ideal because social media is about connecting). Questionnaires are a good way to also get feedback on products and services offered by your brand to improve or create something entirely new.</p>
<p>Quizzes are a good way to make your content go viral because they’re fun and people love to show off how much they know so they’ll be more likely to share it with family and friends.</p>
<h5>4. Podcasts [Facebook, Twitter]</h5>
<p>The rise of smart mobile devices has made the use of podcast become a fast and convenient way of creating content for social media pages.</p>
<p>Podcasts humanizes your brand and gives it a voice and some personality. This is good for building trust and encouraging engagement, but might not be suitable for every brand.</p>
<h5>5. Slideshows and Pictures [Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat]</h5>
<p>Slides, pictures, and infographic help to break down bulky content into smaller bits and focus on one idea at a time. You can use Microsoft PowerPoint to convert your content to slides and share on your social media pages.</p>
<p>You can also use products like Slideshare on LinkedIn and Slide boom to convert your PowerPoint presentation to flash for easy sharing. For pictures, get HD quality pictures from sites like Pexels, Unsplash Isorepublic etc. and edit them to your taste using Canva or any other free online picture editor.</p>
<h5>6. &#8220;How to&#8221; Type of Content for (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest)</h5>
<p>A significant demand for information has driven the “how to” type of content into one of the most read type of content on social media.</p>
<p>With a significant increase in demand for information, “how-to” type of content is so popular that it can be in any format and still attract an audience.</p>
<p>When writing, give practical and useful information that helps your audience achieve their goals in real time.</p>
<p>Find out the major pain points of your audience and help them solve it in a step-by-step guide. They will happily engage with your content.</p>
<h5>7. Create Lists [Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest]</h5>
<p>Like “how to” type of content, Lists are also a popular type of content.</p>
<p>In a world where the average attention span is 3 seconds, lists are a great way to pass across important or useful information in seconds.</p>
<p>Examples of such type of content are: 10 fruits that are grown in only one part of the world, 15 top financial institutions in the world, and so on. Once you pick a good topic and pick a number, your list is halfway done. Create a list on your social media pages and watch it work its magic.</p>
<h5>8. Use Links [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>On social media, people prefer information to be as brief as possible. So to get people to read your long-form content, put it in a blog on your website, then share the links to your social media pages. You could also curate content from other websites that are useful and relevant to your audience and share them as links on your social media pages.</p>
<h5>9. E-books [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>This is a long content packaged in a different format, usually as a PDF or epub file. E-books help strengthen your authority within a field, and it is a powerful method of sharing your content with others. E-books are downloadable and offer a brilliant avenue to generate leads and capture information about website visitors.</p>
<h5>10. Interview [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>Face-to-face interviews are a great way to create content.  You give your audience a unique insight into a topic when you interview professionals, ordinary people on the street or other people of interest in any field and on any topic. It can be in Video or Long Content format, just be sure it’s relevant and rich in quality to your audience.</p>
<h5>11. Research [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>Research makes you an authority and expert in your field. When you do the hard work and get it right, people who need your findings will always reference you when they quote your work and include backlinks to your website.</p>
<p>Doing research is very time-consuming though but always worth it especially when your research is thorough and of high quality. The findings of your research can be converted to any format for easy distribution across social media platforms.</p>
<h5>12. Reviews [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube]</h5>
<p>Reviews are great and are a highly sought after form of content if you’re in some type of industry like the tech industry. People like to do research before purchasing any product online and a positive review helps them make informed decisions. Products and services in any industry can be reviewed. So help buyers make better decisions when purchasing by writing product reviews.</p>
<h5>13. Pure Text [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>This is the use of text alone (letters) to disseminate information. All you need do is get creative with your writing. Tell stories, everyone loves a good story. Ensure the beginning of your text is captivating enough to get your audience to read through to the end. Most importantly, be as brief as you possibly can. Use suspense and mystery to get them to come back for more.</p>
<p>Finally, to grow your fan-base and increase engagement on your social media page you must know your audience, how they think, their habits, and online routines. When that is fully understood, you can now choose the best way(s) to reach them.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my job as a digital marketing professional, I often meet a lot of Marketing Managers and Business Owners who eagerly admit having a website when a marketing discussion is on the table. But when I probe further by asking the following questions;</p>
<p>Is your website mobile responsive?</p>
<p>Do you have analytics software installed on your website?</p>
<p>Do you update the content (Resources and Blog) or add new content frequently?</p>
<p>Most of the answers I get are NO or I DON’T KNOW and I am sure a good number of people reading this will most likely respond the same way. If you answered NO to any of the questions, then you have a billboard, not a website.</p>
<p>Your website ought to be your business home on the web, a virtual office of sorts with a smiling receptionist (navigation tabs and great content) waiting to greet visitors and direct them to the appropriate office. It is supposed to be your number one sales tool; constantly on duty.</p>
<p>It should be able to attract and keep the attention of your prospects, sell your products and services which are tailored to meet the needs of your prospects and existing clients and have great content that is known for problem-solving or being educative.</p>
<p>Let’s review a couple of qualities that a good and business generating website should have.</p>
<h5>9 Qualities of a Lead Generating Website</h5>
<h5>1. It should be mobile responsive</h5>
<p>Your website should be compatible with mobile devices both in the area of display, screen resolution, and loading speed. This will give visitors the ability to read the content without having to scroll sideways to finish a sentence or zoom in to make text or pictures legible.</p>
<p>It will also help your mobile search optimization as Google ranks mobile compliant websites high in mobile search.  That is; when a user uses a mobile phone to search the web, mobile websites and websites that are mobile-friendly appear first and at the top. With 85% of Nigerians accessing the internet through their mobile phones today, you will knock yourself out of the market if your website is not mobile friendly.</p>
<h5>2. It should focus on your customers</h5>
<p>Your website should be built with your customers and prospects in mind. The content shouldn’t focus on your press releases, laurels and news about you. Your customers and prospects are not interested in that. Instead, your content should be geared towards identifying their pain points and proffering solutions to help solve these pain points.</p>
<h5>3. It should add value to the visitors to keep them coming back</h5>
<p>So you have launched your website, it has an impeccable design, it is mobile responsive and you have analytics set up. What next?</p>
<p>You have to keep updating your content regularly (I am assuming here that your website has a blog or a section for Resources). Whatever content you launched with will become stale after a couple of weeks. You need to keep adding content weekly or fortnightly to keep your visitors coming back for more informative and educative content.</p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule to the frequency of posting. You just have to work out something that is convenient. However, consistency is key and subsequently, It is expected that your frequency will increase once you find your rhythm.</p>
<h5>4. It should have analytics to monitor your visitors and their patterns</h5>
<p>This is simply monitoring your visitors to understand their patterns: the number of people visiting your site, the pages they visit most, Content they read, the website that referred them to your site, the device they are logging in from etc.</p>
<p>This will help you understand their drivers and help you solve their pain points accurately. There are several tools to help you keep track of your site’s visitors, e.g. <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://moz.com/">Moz</a>, <a href="https://www.compete.com/">Compete</a> etc. Some are free while some others are paid. You can also use the information to tailor specific ads to specific groups or people and sync your paid advertising to help you track effectively.</p>
<h5>5. It should have call-to-action buttons to aid the conversion process</h5>
<p>Your website should have call-to-action buttons and they should clearly state what action you’re asking the reader to perform. For example, if you want users to subscribe to your newsletter or blog posts, put a stand-alone subscribe button. Don’t hide it under the &#8220;<strong><em>Contact Us</em></strong>&#8221; tab or use one tab for &#8220;<em><strong>Contact Us</strong></em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em><strong>Subscribe</strong></em>&#8220;.</p>
<h5>6. A lead generating website should load speedily</h5>
<p>In this age when people have extremely short attention span, a website taking ages to load is one of the main reasons it’s abandoned by a prospect. People don’t like to be kept waiting and loading speed is one of the criteria for ranking high on google searches.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.seochat.com/c/a/google-optimization-help/average-page-load-time-of-top-ranking-websites-in-google/">study</a> has shown that the estimated loading time of the top ranking sites on Google is between 9-15 seconds. In addition to this, some areas in Nigeria still experience less effective Mobile data connection compared to some countries that have more advanced mobile data connection. It is common knowledge that the slower the data connection, the more time it takes a page to load.</p>
<p>Already have your website up? You can use <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">Web Page Test</a>, <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a>, <a href="http://loadfocus.com/">Load Focus</a> and many other tools to measure your website loading speed.</p>
<h5>7. A lead generating website should be optimised for search engines</h5>
<p>A good website should be optimised for the relevant keywords and links. This will help its page ranking and visibility.</p>
<p>The key to this is to do a keyword research before you begin your website development and then build it into your website content.  You can use <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords/">Google AdWords</a>, <a href="http://keywordtool.io/">keyword Tool</a> or even Google Search for your keyword research. These tools will show you specific keywords that your prospects are searching for and the search volume for those words.</p>
<h5>8. It should have an eye candy design</h5>
<p>Having a great website design and color palette astronomically increases the chances of getting and keeping a prospect’s attention. It makes them curious to see what you have to offer and more willing to respond to calls to action. This is important because there are millions of businesses out there offering the same services and products as you, so you have to rise above the noise and be unique.</p>
<p>Remember to keep it professional though, as it reflects your company’s image and consumer perception is key. Most importantly, you need to use colours and designs that will appeal to your target audience.</p>
<h5>9. It should be easy to navigate</h5>
<p>Organise the information on your website in a simple and structured way that will help your visitors find what they are looking for. Have clear tabs that lead visitors to relevant sections of your website. Direct your call to actions to relevant links so they can get things done with one click.</p>
<p>Lastly, make sure that no links are broken as this may be frustrating and make the customer abandon a purchase or an enquiry thus making you lose business.</p>
