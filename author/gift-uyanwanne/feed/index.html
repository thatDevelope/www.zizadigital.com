										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What first comes to mind when you need to buy a mobile phone, replace your washing machine, locate a restaurant nearby, or reach out to a Law or Auditing Firm for consultation?</p>
<p><strong>Google.</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, the first page of Google, where your entries into the search engine will likely resemble:</p>
<p>“best phones (within your price range)”,</p>
<p>“best washing machines”</p>
<p>“restaurants near me”,</p>
<p>“best (name of service) firms near me.</p>
<p>The unique search pages that appear first—the ones you’re most likely to click on— are only able to do so by the power of SEO.</p>
<h5>What is SEO?</h5>
<p>Simply put, search engine optimization (SEO) is a strategy to ensure that when someone googles your service category, your firm’s website comes top.</p>
<p>Regardless of the niche of services you’re in— Engineering, Architecture, Telecommunications, HR, Fintech, etc., —your overall digital marketing plan ought to include a search engine optimization strategy for some relevance in today’s market. This way, when people search for your services, your firm appears on the first page of Google.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<div class="bd_img">
<img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="933" height="602" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-354" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screenshot-www.google.com-2021.03.17-11_45_42.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screenshot-www.google.com-2021.03.17-11_45_42.png 933w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screenshot-www.google.com-2021.03.17-11_45_42-300x194.png 300w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/screenshot-www.google.com-2021.03.17-11_45_42-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" />
</div>
<p><strong>7 reasons professional services firms like yours should invest in SEO include:</strong></p>
<h5>SEO increases your brand visibility and ranking.</h5>
<p>Visibility is a term that describes how prominent a particular domain is in search engine results while Ranking is the process that search engines use to determine where a particular web page in SERPs should come up.</p>
<p>In a recent study by <a href="https://research.hubspot.com/charts/77-of-consumers-research-before-engaging-with-a-brand">HubSpot</a>, it was found that 77% of people research a brand before engaging with it.</p>
<p>Lower search visibility occurs when a domain isn’t visible for many relevant search queries, interpreted as lower rankings. In a nutshell, your professional service firm is leaving money on the table by not positioning itself right (with SEO) and leveraging this audience of people who use search.</p>
<p>In the long run, your brand’s visibility and rankings will impact the main SEO objectives – traffic and conversions.</p>
<p>In a world where B2B buyers carry out a dozen searches, on average, before engaging with a brand, coupled with <a href="https://searchengineland.com/report-google-beats-amazon-product-search-reach-rival-sees-greater-loyalty-282570">18% more shoppers</a> preferring Google to Amazon, investing in SEO is a smart move to increase the chances of your pages coming top, thereby positioning your brand throughout almost their entire buying journey.</p>
<h5>2. SEO communicates with your target audience</h5>
<p>Which would you rather do: invest in creating helpful resources and making helpful information more easily accessible to people looking for them, or making passes people might find intruding and annoying (cold calling, spam emails, interruptive ads, random billboards, and handbills) primarily because they didn’t ask for it in the first place?</p>
<p>Thankfully, one of the biggest advantages of SEO is that it’s an inbound marketing strategy. What this means is that unlike traditional (outbound) advertising channels, which involve reaching out to consumers whether they want to hear from you or not, inbound methods center on making it easy for your audience to find you when they want information.</p>
<p>Not only is this much more convenient for consumers, it also results in more qualified leads for your business. What is more effective than reaching out to a prospect with relevant answers while they’re already considering contracting a service you render?</p>
<p>In fact, in HubSpot’s most recent State of Inbound report, 59% of marketers said that inbound practices provided the highest quality leads for their sales teams.</p>
<p>Focus on attracting users who are actively looking for information related to your services, you’ll be much more effective in reaching your target audience.</p>
<h5>3. SEO is a cost-effective way to do marketing</h5>
<p>SEO gets more clicks than PPC. This is despite the fact that PPC ads appear above organic rankings.</p>
<p>A lot of work (obviously) goes into doing SEO right. But a mastery of the needful technicalities will make the digital world become your oyster.</p>
<p>When you consider that <a href="https://www.zerolimitweb.com/organic-vs-ppc-2019-ctr-results-best-practices/">71.33% of searches</a> result in a click on an organic<em> </em>result on the first page, and the fact that you can market virtually all of your services for next to no cash out of your pocket, it would be an effort truly worth it.</p>
<p>Another cost-effective yet super-efficient way professional services firms can connect with their audience is via Podcasts. You can read all about it here.</p>
<h5>4. Attributable &amp; Measurable Organizational Growth</h5>
<p>One of the many benefits of SEO is that it allows you to objectively track your company’s growth.</p>
<p>Relevant details like the duration visitors spend on your site, the number of pages they visit, etc. ’ll help your firm take more informed decisions to boost your market shares.</p>
<p>What’s more? While growth is a metric that every business will always strive for, it’s more than simply a badge of honor. Possessing the data of your business’s current growth (and potential for growth) is a stellar way to attract investors if you happen to be in need of funding, or take the decision to start another company.</p>
<h5>5. SEO will help you build a long-term audience.</h5>
<p>Paying for Ad placements; be it search engine marketing (SEM) pay-per-click, programmatic ads, and the likes, will only bring you short term results for a high price.</p>
<p>These modes of advertisements are not bad in themselves, but take the back seat as statistics prove that even if yours is a firm big enough to pull off running ads on multiple platforms 365 days of the year, SEO favours brand credibility and trust.</p>
<p>With SEO, you get to consistently provide your website visitors with the content they want, in place of having traffic downswing the moment an advert budget runs out, thereby building a community of clients. They’ll consider you a resource hub, the go-to firm, and not the intrusive one.</p>
<h5>6. Overtake the Competition</h5>
<p>So, chances are that your competitors make up the <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing">61% of marketers </a>who say “improving their SEO and improving their online presence is a top priority”. This means that they are likely already taking steps to establish high rankings in search results and if you’re not moving forward and improving your position, you’re losing ground to a competitor who is.</p>
<p>SEO is a widely acclaimed staple of any digital marketing strategy, which makes it a valuable tool you can’t afford to ignore for too long.</p>
<p>The earlier you get on board with an SEO strategy of your own, the higher your chances of keeping up with and ideally, moving ahead of your competitions.</p>
<h5>7. SEO will help you make informed business decisions</h5>
<p>In addition to advancing your brand visibility, establishing thought leadership, and garnering customers’ trust, SEO is also a major research resource.</p>
<p>The best part is that the same data that helps you understand customer behavior can be further expanded and used for a host of other marketing actions. The knowledge can be applied to the overall business strategy to shape the decisions your firm makes, resulting in bountiful ROI.</p>
<p>Once you figure out the consumer, converting them is easier work.</p>
<p>All you have to do is to segment your audiences, automate your marketing processes, and voila!</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>Considering <a href="https://www.zerolimitweb.com/organic-vs-ppc-2021-ctr-results-best-practices/">93% of all web traffic</a> comes from Google, it is only natural that the most coveted position for any business (website) is to rank on page one organically; a process known as SEO.</p>
<p>Having your firm rank on the first page of Google, gives you the bountiful benefits of consistent leads, calls, and customers, which is why achieving this feat can be challenging not to mention highly competitive. But like any great success, those results require a fair amount of time, effort, and SEO expertise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most professional services firms clearly understand the benefits that digital marketing can bring to their business. In any case, it is obvious to even a blind man that people are spending more time online than they previously did and Covid-19 has further increased the time spent online.</p>
<p>While knowing the benefits is fine, implementing it for your firm in order to enjoy these benefits is quite a different story.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a custodian of a professional services brand and would like to implement Digital Marketing for your business, here is where to start.</strong></p>
<h5>1. Identify Your Business Goals</h5>
<p>The right place to start is strategically highlighting your firm’s business goals- what are you looking to achieve? Visibility? Leads? Conversions? In some cases, it may be all 3.</p>
<p>Whatever your goals may be, have them spelt out in detail, as this will enable you to target and measure success or otherwise of your actions better.</p>
<h5>2. Create your Digital Marketing Strategy</h5>
<p>It’s no secret that your line of work makes you besties with documents of several pages, but this is not one of such.</p>
<p>Putting together a strategy for your firm is simply a task that requires you to put aside some planning and thinking time to answer a few critical questions, and provide answers to some others. This exercise will help you identify your businesses’ purpose and to bring a focus for your digital marketing efforts. It will provide a framework, a guidance for the entirety of your marketing actions.</p>
<h5><strong>A competent digital marketing strategy has four essential elements:</strong></h5>
<p>A. <strong>Differentiators:</strong> What sets you apart from the other Law,<br />
Engineering, HR, Accounting or Consulting firms? What is your unique selling point?</p>
<p>B. <strong>Market Positioning:</strong> This is an offshoot of your differentiators. Your market positioning provides your audiences with a cohesive and compelling story they need to prefer your firm over your competitors.</p>
<p>C. <strong>Key messages:</strong> For success on this route, you ought to have key messages for each of your unique audiences. The same<br />
message for a regular client being served to a prospective influencer won’t cut it.</p>
<p>D. <strong>Content Strategy:</strong> Once you have documented your overall<br />
strategy, the next step is to select the right content strategy and tactics you will use to deliver key messages to your target audiences. This is the mode through which you will communicate your expertise, build trust, and demonstrate to potential clients how you can help them. Is it via videos, blog posts, infographics, email marketing, podcasts, etc. or just two or all of these? What tone will it carry? How often will you share?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is point worthy to note that social media is an integral part of any digital marketing strategy. In defining your Social Media core, you will need to provide answers to some of the questions below:</p>
<p><strong>Who is my target audience?</strong><br />
This will depend on the kind of customers you are looking to get into business with and/or how much you are willing to invest in digital marketing. Whatever you do, you want to go where your target audience is most comfortable. For most professional services firms, LinkedIn and Twitter are always good social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>What is my message?</strong><br />
What themes, topics, or narrative will my content be based on?</p>
<p><strong>What channels can I realistically commit to?</strong><br />
If the Noun ‘impact’ excites you, then you should consider conducting a<br />
thorough research and deciding based on the platforms you can realistically commit to and the one where your target audience is most comfortable with. There are lots of Social Media platforms and if you do not have the personnel and investment to cover all, it is best to select a few. It is not a good practice to spread yourself thin.</p>
<p><strong>What am I trying to achieve on each of these </strong>channels?<br />
how else would you measure your wins unless you first clearly spell<br />
out your aim?</p>
<p><strong>How will I measure my success?</strong><br />
Evaluation is essential and you should know from the beginning, the metrics you are going to measure to judge digital marketing drive successful.</p>
<p>Consider this a ‘welcome package’: <a href="https://www.zizadigital.com/how-to-create-a-digital-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Develop A Digital Marketing </a><a href="https://www.zizadigital.com/how-to-create-a-digital-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy (Template Included)</a></p>
<h5>3. Conduct a Target Audience Research</h5>
<p>Another important step in putting together a digital marketing strategy for a professional service firm is conducting a detailed target audience research.</p>
<p>There is no business if you don’t know who you’re selling to. Your target audience research will cut across your current and potential clients, referral sources, and industry influencers, and each will go as detailed as their unique behavioural patterns &#8211; who they are, their pain points, what they are looking to achieve, how they spend their free time, yes, that detailed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there are two kinds of research you can do. The first approach is the Secondary Research, which is simply sampling your target audience based on research already carried out by a similar firm in your field. The other is the Primary Research, which requires you to conduct an original study of your target audience.</p>
<p>A combination of both research styles is known to birth the best results. You get a rounded well-informed view of your audience, making your digital marketing efforts more of a science than an amateur guessing game.</p>
<h5>4. Set Specific Goals and Determine How You Will Measure Them</h5>
<p>When it comes to measuring how well you are faring in the pursuit of your goals, it is important to do so using the right metrics, and not have your analytics based on/limited to vanity metrics like the number of likes, followers, shares, views, etc.<br />
Check out this article on the real <a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/9-marketing-metrics-you-should-measure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing metrics you should measure for accurate data.</a></p>
<h5>5. Use a Marketing Software</h5>
<p>Effective digital marketing for professional services firms is based on three pillars &#8211; Strategy, Content and Software. The Software is the tool that drives the implementation of the strategy and the content and having the right software cannot be overemphasized.</p>
<p>A marketing  tool like <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubspot</a> offers you a platform to build landing pages for your campaigns, share your social posts and measure them, reach out to your prospects and customers through email marketing, research and grow your SEO visibility, build sequences, marketing automation, CRM etc.<br />
If you are still running your marketing manually, then you should consider getting a software to multiply the success of your digital marketing efforts.</p>
<h5>IN CONCLUSION:</h5>
<p>What better season to take a swing in the direction of digital marketing than in these times of Covid-19 when physical sales and interaction is limited and people are spending more time online?</p>
<p>With a solid inbound marketing strategy and a formidable digital team and/or agency to help implement the day to day deliverables, you are well on your way to making your brand the top-of-mind choice for your industry.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lead generation is the process of attracting strangers and prospects into your business’ contact management system, with the aim of making them instant or future customers.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, engagement and sales have most likely slowed down for your brand, for some businesses, it is actually non-existent. Several experts have predicted that there is likely to be a recession post-COVID-19. Some have gone on to say that there may be a devaluation of currencies, a hike in inflation rates and a total market shakeup. With predictions like these, businesses are on the tip of their chairs and are wondering, what next post Covid-19? What are the salient things we need to implement to help us weather the storm?</p>
<p>Chances are you will need to generate new leads for a fast and powerful comeback. Wipe those sweat beads, we’ve got you. Below are seven tested-and-true lead magnets that will fetch your business hot leads post the COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
<h5>1. Value-adding Videos</h5>
<p>HubSpot reports that customers are four times more likely to click on a video than read about a product, and 52% of marketers around the world name video as the content with the best ROI.</p>
<p>Make a short video- how to…, a DIY, or one showcasing fancy ways to use your product. The agenda is to tackle a problem or create value for a prospect. Provided he/she learns something useful from your site or social media page, the next time they have a need related to the service you provide, they are most likely to head your way, and depending on what this need might be, they will be ready and willing to convert.</p>
<p>You can also try the initial 2-3 minutes for free to get them hooked, and then ask them to drop an email address to continue watching.</p>
<h5>Cheatsheets</h5>
<p>Cheat sheets are simple and concise guides proffering insights on how a task might be carried out. They are similar to e-books but only more comprehensive, as all the focus is on how to perform an action. No schooling on why it should be done, nothing ambiguous or time-consuming, just the best and quickest way to get it done.</p>
<p>Potential formats for cheat sheets might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step-by-step guides on particular tasks (e.g. How to setup a chat bot on your website)</li>
<li>Templates (e.g.,<a href="https://www.zizadigital.com/how-to-create-a-digital-marketing-strategy/"> How to develop a digital marketing strategy (template included, Tax Calculation Template)</a></li>
<li>Checklists (e.g., Content promotion checklist)</li>
</ul>
<h5>3. Downloadable Content</h5>
<p>The good thing about downloadable content is that they are super affordable and easy to create. In fact, it is as easy as converting one of your blog posts into a pdf and position it as a lead magnet. You just have to stick to the premium rule: offer value. Keep in mind the stage of the and the need for you to offer real insights. If someone gives you their contact information, it’s only fair you provide some good enough value in return. Besides, lead generation is only a part of your grand marketing plan. Without a convincing reason to ride with you, they most likely will leave the sales funnel, which I’m sure is not something you are enthusiastic to see happen.</p>
<h5>4. Trial period</h5>
<p>It is not uncommon to find prospects adamant to convert until they have confirmed a product or service is right for them. For such potential customers, a trial tames their fears.</p>
<p>This is also a grand opportunity for you to strategically make your service one so valuable they can’t or don’t want to live without.</p>
<h5>Discounts</h5>
<p>A good deal is always an easy way to get lead traffic. I mean, who doesn&#8217;t smile at the sight of a discounted offer? The bottom line is everyone appreciates a deal. Therefore, placing a discount on products/services you offer can be a great way to push someone over the edge not only into sharing their contact information with you, but also to stick with you if not for your great services, for future discounts and promotions.</p>
<h5>Quizzes</h5>
<p>How many times have you clicked on a quiz to figure out how well your friends know you or what you would look like with a different colour of hair on?</p>
<p>Provided you are able to tie them to your brand, quizzes can be a fun way to engage your audience and scoop leads.</p>
<p>This kind of lead generation tactic can bring a wealth of resourceful insight into your overall inbound marketing activities.</p>
<h5>7. Host a giveaway</h5>
<p>Giveaways are one of the chief most successful lead generation practices of all time. Indisputable is the fact that it is a popular way to generate a bunch of stale leads that do not benefit your business, but if properly carried out, chances of this happening can be greatly minimized.</p>
<p>The secret recipe is to ensure that what you&#8217;re giving away is something people actually want; something of value that relates to your line of business.</p>
<p>A giveaway generates leads via social media engagement and email subscriptions, which is a win-win for you and your prospects. On the bright side, it doesn’t matter so much if a user wins or loses the giveaway, they will continue to engage with your brand in hopes of getting lucky enough to win future giveaways.</p>
