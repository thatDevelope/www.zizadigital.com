]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many professional services firms do not have a marketing department or team. Quite a few don&#8217;t even have a single dedicated individual who focuses on promoting their company.</p>
<p>Often, sales and marketing fall to the owner, director, CEO, COO, or a high-level company leader. They already have their hands full, and building a successful lead-generation strategy quickly becomes an afterthought.</p>
<p>While you need tactics that generate revenue now — you also know that focusing solely on the “here and now” will leave you constantly chasing the next lead.</p>
<p>Organisations that are looking to grow need to strategize their lead-generation into something repeatable and reliable in order to have business stability and predictable growth.</p>
<p>That’s where podcasts come in.</p>
<p>With the right approach, you can use your podcast episodes to connect with potential customers and build a relationship long before they even signify interest in your services. Podcasting gives you short-term returns while building content and relationships for long-term growth.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the details of how to use podcasts to connect with leads and see how you can reap the benefits for your organisation. Before we do that, let&#8217;s even understand what Podcasting is.</p>
<h5>What Is Podcasting?</h5>
<p>A podcast is a series of audio content episodes, focused on a particular theme. In a world where everyone is constantly on the move and people crave more information, podcasting has become a great way to share content and an important piece of the marketing pie.</p>
<p>The purpose of Podcasting is to create conversations that help to solve the pain points or challenges that your ideal prospects and/or clients face. These conversations can feature different guests and thought leaders who have expertise in the subject area. Some of these guests can even be Clients or prospects and it may lead to sales opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Podcasting opens a door for you to create genuine relationships with industry experts, thought leaders, and your ideal clients. Asking prospects and clients to be your podcast guest allows you to break the ice and get one-on-one time with your target customers while also sharing real insights from people who have real experiences on the topic of discussion. For example, I was recently featured as a guest on the <a href="https://pichastock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picha</a> Podcast where i shared insights on Influencer Marketing. You can <a href="https://pichastock.com/blog/2020/10/21/talking-influencer-marketing-with-agbons-igiewe-pichapodcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listen on Picha blog</a> or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-883298473/pichapodcast-episode-4-talking-influencer-marketing-with-agbons-igiewe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listen on Soundcloud</a></p>
<h5><strong>What is Account-Based Podcasting?</strong></h5>
<p>Account-based podcasting is a podcasting strategy that concentrates resources on a set of target accounts within a market and seeks to help solve the subject challenge for that market.</p>
<h5><strong>3 Benefits of Account Based Podcasting</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Benefit #1: One-on-One Time With Your Ideal Customers</strong></h5>
<p>If you’ve ever done any prospecting like cold calling or cold emailing, you know how quickly people will give you the cold shoulder. It&#8217;s rare to come across someone who will respond positively to your message.</p>
<p>No one likes to receive some random sales pitch from someone they don’t know, so you&#8217;ll be ignored or worse. These days, if they choose to take offence, they can easily <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/authorspeakeradvisor_if-you-folks-keep-spamming-me-on-linkedin-activity-6722183704665559040--Gbt" target="_self" rel="noopener">call you out</a> on social media.</p>
<p>With account-based podcasting, you can make cold emailing work for you in a way that you couldn’t before. Instead of a sales pitch, you’re offering to promote them on your show for free.</p>
<p>Most people are flattered when asked for an interview. Because of that, it&#8217;s relatively easy to get people to be a guest on your podcast.</p>
<p>Use a template like the one below when you do your outreach, and you’ll likely have your first few guests lined up in no time. I’ve included a template shared by Bernie Borges at the last <a href="https://www.inbound.com/2020-speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot Inbound 2020 Conference</a>.</p>
<h5><strong>Sample Outreach Template</strong></h5>
<div class="bd_img">
<img decoding="async" width="825" height="370" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-377" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads.png 825w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-300x135.png 300w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" />
</div>
<h5><strong>Template in Action</strong></h5>
<div class="bd_img">
<img decoding="async" width="859" height="411" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-378" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-1.png 859w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-1-300x144.png 300w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-1-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" />
</div>
<p>Using this strategy gets you talking with your ideal customers fast, and it enables you to build relationships with them naturally. You stand a much better chance of converting them into paying clients in the future should the need arise for them to use your services.</p>
<h5><strong>Benefit #2: Each Episode Creates Several Types of Content</strong></h5>
<p>When recording your podcast episodes, don’t make the mistake of recording just the audio. Record your interviews using video so that you can get the benefit of creating multiple types of content simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can upload the video to your YouTube channel and publish it on your website with a blog. You’ll also get the benefit of turning your video into an audio-only file so you can share it on all the podcasting channels.</p>
<p>If you use a program like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maz0TVyTwiw" target="_self" rel="noopener">Descript</a>, you can generate a transcript of the video for use on your blog or podcast show notes. Descript even lets you clean up your &#8220;ums&#8221; and &#8220;uhs,&#8221; and fix mistakes without re-recording the episode.</p>
<p>Producing and publishing all this content allows you to generate backlinks and increase your website&#8217;s search engine ranking. In the meantime, with your podcast, you&#8217;re building authority in your industry, creating brand awareness, and opening doors to potential clients.</p>
<h5><strong>Benefit #3: It Establishes You as a Thought Leader</strong></h5>
<p>Have you ever noticed that when you hang around experts, other people assume you’re an expert too? If not, you’ll definitely start to notice it when you launch your new podcast show.</p>
<p>Not only will people assume you’re an expert, but over time, you’ll become one. The longer you do the show and the more people you interview, the more you’ll learn about your ideal customers.</p>
<p>You’ll come to understand them and their industry on a whole new level because you’ll continuously hear insiders’ perspectives from your guests.</p>
<p>As a bonus, you’ll clarify your messaging and improve your services with the more you learn about your customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Marketing</h5>
<p>Your professional services firm is most on the path to failure or indefinite struggle without a marketing strategy. Nevertheless, the presence of one does not guarantee success. There are a number of actions prone to endangering your brand perception, as well as negatively impacting your ROI.</p>
<p>In working with several professional services firms across Nigeria, we have identified 5 marketing mistakes that are common with these firms. Read on to learn these five mistakes and how to avoid them in your own organisation.</p>
<h5>1. Not having a dedicated marketing team:</h5>
<p>Professional Services firms often run marketing as an extension of the MD&#8217;s desk. This means that there is no dedicated marketing staff or team to do mind the task. In its stead is an MD who implements marketing tactics at his convenience and mostly in piece meals as he neither has the time nor the expertise to implement strategic marketing communications for the firm.</p>
<p>One implication of this is that the value gained from marketing in this kind of firm will be next to nothing and as time goes on, the MD might be inclined to think that marketing doesn&#8217;t achieve results. The budget invested in marketing in a firm like this will be wasted.</p>
<p>Another consequence is that if the firm has a strong competition that is focused on consistent marketing with a desk of dedicated and strong marketing professionals, it will only be a matter of time before the competitor overtakes the firm.</p>
<h5>2. Long approval process:</h5>
<p>This is especially true for firms that do not have a dedicated marketing team. The aftermath of which being the approval process for marketing projects will be tedious and hard as there is no one consciously looking out for these projects. Besides, professional services firms are conservative in nature and have long approval processes.</p>
<p>Marketing, on the other hand, moves at the speed of light and long approval processes may hinder marketing campaigns or projects that are time-sensitive; especially consumer-generated campaigns based on latest industry news or trends, some of which have potency of between one day to one week.</p>
<p>Waiting for the admin to pass it to the GM’s Secretary/PA who then has to weigh the importance and then presents it to the GM when other priorities have given way, which may be two weeks later and no longer relevant at that time.</p>
<h5>3. Treating marketing as an afterthought:</h5>
<p>Most professional service firms do not make allowance for marketing while planning for their firms. It is often treated as an afterthought and receives almost no attention.</p>
<p>This is a mistake that any firm looking to gain relevance and thrive should have no hands in.</p>
<p>Brands often make the mistake of treating marketing only as an afterthought to be looked into when it seems they are way in over their heads and are struggling to keep afloat. Implementing marketing only when the organisation has challenges only puts pressure on marketing to focus on short term goals and tactics like promos, price slash etc.</p>
<h5>4. Not implementing marketing as a long-term project:</h5>
<p>A number of the professional services firms that invest in marketing do so on an ad-hoc basis. They implement a project once in two years and for a short period of time and never consider it again until a distant future. Meanwhile, marketing is supposed to be a huge part of your everyday project in running the organisation.</p>
<p>In one study, it was found that all that is needed to put off a potential client is one moment of dissatisfaction usually from lack of service, speed of return on assignments, lack of insight or experience in a specific sector; all of which is an action inconsistent marketing projects promote.</p>
<p>Like I always say, marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. It is actually never done.</p>
<h5>5. Lack of marketing budget:</h5>
<p>Having things in motion to create content is only the first step. Even more important is the need to strategically have it appear in front of the right audience via hyper-targeted promotions.</p>
<p>For a firm where marketing was not planned for in the first place, there is almost always no budget set aside for it. Without an active budget, nothing gets implemented.</p>
<p>To quote Stuart H. Britt, &#8220;Doing business without advertising is like winking at a girl in the dark. You know what you&#8217;re doing, but nobody else does.&#8221;</p>
<p>You need a marketing budget where your marketing team can periodically dip their hands into to promote your firm’s content to garner the right amount and type of website traffic and leads that will fill your funnel and grow your business.</p>
<p>To correct this mistake, consider including a marketing budget to your firm’s annual budget, to be channeled towards paid advertising like Google Pay-Per-Click (PPC), search engine marketing (SEM) or LinkedIn/other social media sponsored updates are a great way to get your content before the right ‘eyeballs’ as you&#8217;re building your organic audience.</p>
<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
<p>Developing a marketing strategy is vital for the survival and growth of any business. Without one, your efforts to attract and retain customers are likely to be hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>With an effective marketing plan in place, you’ll be able to straighten out such things as who your actual customers are versus who you thought they were, potential new growth opportunities, make viable marketing investments, and avoid these five plus other marketing mistakes that could hurt your firm’s lead generation opportunities and brand reputation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The beginning of a new year instigates an itch for most Marketing Managers and CEOs to implement new marketing programs for the year.</p>
<p>Halt!</p>
<p>Before you get out the markers and the whiteboards, have you audited your marketing efforts for 2020 vis-à-vis the business impact and realities?</p>
<p>While implementing new marketing programs for 2021 is a significant step expected of any brand that is serious about growth; auditing your 2020 marketing efforts will help improve the success of your 2021 marketing programs.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, we do not focus this audit on vanity metrics and how colourful the campaigns were, but on marketing’s impact on the business objectives and overall business growth. This audit differs from the general marketing audit which focuses on little wins like the number of social media followers, blog posts published, etc. We expect that the general audit for the marketing department should precede this marketing impact audit.</p>
<p>As a business owner or marketing manager that understands the value of growth, here are 3 reasons all brands need to perform a Marketing Impact Audit.</p>
<h5>3 Reasons to Audit Your Marketing Efforts</h5>
<p>1.Marketing Impact Audit will help you understand what worked in 2020. Technically, take a cue and implement more of what worked in the previous year.<br />
2. It will help you understand what didn’t work. With this, you will know what marketing programs to reduce or perhaps totally take out of your calendar.<br />
3. It will give an obvious clue to what we should add to the marketing plan for the current year, giving the trends and innovation you noticed in the previous year.</p>
<p>Now that we have established 3 reasons your brand needs to carry out a Marketing Impact Audit, <strong>here are 8 important questions you need to find answers to in auditing the impact of your marketing efforts</strong> for 2020 before you implement any marketing program in 2021.</p>
<h5>8 Marketing Impact Audit Questions</h5>
<h5>1. Revenue: What product or services generated the most revenue in 2020?</h5>
<p>This gives a sense of the products or services that your market really wants. With this information, you can dedicate your marketing efforts and budgets to push these products and services.</p>
<h5>2. New Business: What is the volume of new business versus repeat business?</h5>
<p>This question helps you understand the satisfaction of your current customers and may warrant research to see what your current customers actually think of your products or services. While getting new clients/customers is a grand thing, there may just be something scaring away your old clients. It is common knowledge that customer acquisition is an expensive venture and it is cheaper to keep old clients.</p>
<h5>3. New Business: What sources did our new business come from last year?</h5>
<p>This question helps unearth the best platform(s) to reach the target audience and helps to focus the marketing efforts on those platforms. It is an open secret that resources are finite and whatever is available must be channelled to the right path to yield optimum results.</p>
<h5>4. Customer Behaviour: Has the target market shifted in their buying patterns?</h5>
<p>Focusing on the target audience&#8217;s buying pattern is important as it shows what service they need at each point in time and helps in understanding how to improve your services to fit their buying patterns. For example, COVID-19 has made delivery service an important part of most brick-and-mortar products. If you run a restaurant and do not have delivery services, clearly, your market will be restricted to your location. Customers haven’t stopped buying food, they have simply moved to the vendor who can deliver the food to them.</p>
<h5>5. Marketing Channels: What marketing channels worked better last year?</h5>
<p>Clearly, all marketing channels are not born equal. And the channel that worked best for a Real Estate Firm may not necessarily work best for a restaurant business or an Insurance firm. Each firm should understand their best marketing channel from their business audit and then set out to maximise the use of the channel.</p>
<h5>6. Market Segmentation: How did we perform in the various segments of our market? And which segment(-s) should we focus more on this year?</h5>
<p>With this question, you can find out the market segment that is pulling its weight and the one that is lagging. You can decide to have incentives to improve the segment(s) lagging and also put things in place to sustain the segment that is doing well. Sometimes, you may decide to do away with a segment that has been lagging consistently for a certain number of years.</p>
<h5>7. Marketing Tool: What tools worked better for us last year?</h5>
<p>In a digitally driven world, marketing tools have become an essential part of marketing implementation and one can barely do much without them. While they do great work, they can sometimes cost a fortune and with the high number of marketing tools out there, it is important to constantly audit to know if the marketing tool is delivering great value to the organisation while taking urgent steps to remedy or replace it if it is not delivering.</p>
<h5>8. Messaging: What are we known for in our market? Is that what we want to be known for? Is there a need to change the narrative?</h5>
<p>Is the marketing message in tandem with the brand? Is the brand known for what it wants to be known for? Is the message restricting the growth or enhancing it? Is there a need to change the messaging?</p>
<p><strong>In a nutshell,</strong></p>
<p>While these questions aren’t exhaustive, starting with these can help set your 2021 Marketing programs on the right path.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the season where marketing managers and CEOs draw up a digital marketing budget for the upcoming year and the question that usually comes up at a time like this is: what should digital marketing cost?</p>
<p>And what must be included in next year&#8217;s budget?</p>
<p>For many C-suite managers, an exact figure and the risk analysis is all they are waiting for. This exact amount can easily be filled into the blank spaces in the budget template.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not that easy! Because , there isn’t a fixed cost. The cost of digital marketing depends on a lot of variables. For clarity sake, I will outline the platforms, the variables involved and estimate for you a range of costs for each one. That way, you can decide what to budget in line with your marketing objectives and what your organisation can afford.</p>
<h5>What Does Social Media Marketing Cost?</h5>
<p><strong>The average cost for an Agency to manage your Social media pages can range from N250,000 (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira) and above depending on:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>The number of platforms</strong> – Would you like to be on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/ziza_digital" target="_self" rel="noopener">Instagram,</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zizadigital" target="_self" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/zizadigital" target="_self" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pinterest</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.snapchat.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Snapchat</a>, etc.; or only a few of them?</p>
<p>2. <strong>The frequency of posts</strong> – Would you like to have three posts per week or three posts per day?</p>
<p>3. <strong>The kind of posts</strong> – Will the Agency be developing videos, GIFs, or only text and graphics</p>
<p>4. <strong>The Scope of work</strong> &#8211; Will this cover community management?</p>
<p>It must be noted that this does not include media cost that mostly goes to the platform owners for advertising and post sponsorship. Nor does it include the fee for Influencer marketing. Those will have to be treated separately and budgeted for accordingly when the need arises.</p>
<p><strong>The cost of engaging an influencer usually depends on the popularity or brand equity of the influencer and the scope of work required. It can range from N20,000 per post to N300,000 and can go as high as 1 million naira if the Influencer is creating the content.</strong></p>
<p>For Social Media advertising cost, you can budget an average of $0.30 per click for Facebook; $0.50 for Instagram, and $2.50 for LinkedIn. Yes, I can see you rolling your eyes ?, LinkedIn is super expensive.</p>
<p>But the truth is, it gives more quality leads than Facebook, Twitter and Instagram combined. However, it also depends on the industry of the brand that is advertising.</p>
<h5>What Does Email Marketing Cost?</h5>
<p>The basic cost of email marketing is divided into two;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Email Marketing Software cost</strong> – Your email marketing software is the main engine behind email marketing and every business needs a reliable software to run email marketing campaigns. There are several email marketing software solutions but <strong>the average cost can range from $9 and above for 1,000 contacts.</strong> However, as your email contacts increase, so will your software subscription cost.</p>
<p>Also, there will be a consequential increase if you would like to move your email marketing a step further to marketing automation, A/B Testing etc.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Email Content Development Cost</strong> – while the software is the engine that runs email marketing, the content is the lubricant that ensures the engine moves accordingly. Good content will increase your open rate and ultimately your click-through rate. <strong>You can budget an average of N250,000 per month for email marketing content development</strong>. This can get you an average of 4 email campaigns and slightly higher if this includes email sequences which is an important part of marketing automation.</p>
<p><strong>Good content for each email campaign will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The email copy</li>
<li>The title</li>
<li>The Call-to-action</li>
<li>The preview text</li>
</ul>
<h5>What Does Google Advertising Cost?</h5>
<p>Google Advertising is divided into two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Display Network</strong> which shows graphic Ads across several websites</li>
<li><strong>Google Search Network</strong> that shows text ads when someone searches Google for relevant keywords.</li>
</ul>

<div class="bd_img">
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1366" height="768" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-372" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Budgeting-For-Digital-Marketing-What-does-digital-marketing-really-cost-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Budgeting-For-Digital-Marketing-What-does-digital-marketing-really-cost-2.png 1366w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Budgeting-For-Digital-Marketing-What-does-digital-marketing-really-cost-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Budgeting-For-Digital-Marketing-What-does-digital-marketing-really-cost-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Budgeting-For-Digital-Marketing-What-does-digital-marketing-really-cost-2-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" />
</div>
<p>The average cost-per-click (CPC) for Google display network ranges from $0.40 &#8211; $1.20 while the average cost per click (CPC) for Google Search Network is $1 &#8211; $5 depending on the keywords you are bidding for, the industry, the location, and the google optimisation score.</p>
<p>In addition to the media budget, you will need to pay the Agency you are partnering with for the PPC Management. PPC Management is charged at a percentage of the Ad budget.</p>
<p>The fee charged for PPC management can range between 10% to 25% of the Google Advertising budget depending on the relationship between the Client and the Agency and the amount of work required.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may need to also budget for a PPC software that is used for the management of PPC campaigns but this is not compulsory.</p>
<p>On average, small businesses spend around $3,500 (Three thousand, five hundred dollars) a month on Google Ads. This is not cast in stone and can be customised to fit the budget that the client can afford.</p>
<h5>What does Website Development Cost?</h5>
<p><strong>The cost of developing a good website in Nigeria costs between N200,000 and N1,000,000</strong>. The actual cost of the website will depend on the following variables:</p>
<p>1. Will the website be developed from scratch or is the developer using a template?</p>
<p>2. Will it be an E-commerce website or an informational website?</p>
<p>3. How many pages will the website have?</p>
<p>4. Will SEO be implemented on the website?</p>
<p>While some people generally advertise that they can build a website for <strong>N</strong>20,000 (Twenty Thousand Naira), the quality of that kind of website can certainly not be compared to professional websites.</p>
<p>Do note that the cost of developing a website does not include the cost of buying the domain name, the hosting, and SSL. Your domain name is your organisation’s address on the web while the Hosting is the container that holds the domain files. This is where the website will be seated.</p>
<p>All organisations need a domain name to have a website. Your domain name is <a href="http://www.yourcompanyname.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">www.yourcompanyname.com</a>. Both the domain name and hosting are usually provided by a hosting provider like <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hostgator.com</a>, <a href="http://godaddy.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godaddy.com</a>, <a href="http://www.whogohost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whogohost.com</a> etc.</p>
<p><strong>The average cost of a domain name can range from $9 to $15</strong> depending on the kind of domain name. In some cases where the domain has been parked (bought by someone else who is willing to resell), the domain name can sell for as high as $50,000 (Fifty thousand dollars) – Yes, this isn’t a mistake – Fifty Thousand Dollars?!</p>
<p>Some domains are also classified as premium and command a higher fee than the average domain cost.</p>
<p>While the cost of building a website is a one-off cost, you will need to renew your domain and your hosting annually. This fee will need to be paid to your hosting provider.</p>
<p>In some cases where the business does not have a dedicated Brand/Marketing Manager or Writer, you may need to pay for Website Content Development as your website needs good content to communicate your brand equity and generate leads for you. This cost can be included in the website development cost if discussed at the inception of the project.</p>
<p>Once the website has been completed and handed over to the organisation, there is a need for the organisation to retain the services of a website Administrator to manage the website continuously. This person will be responsible for updating plugins, updating content, publishing posts, etc. This person needs not be a staff, he/she can be a freelancer or an Agency that manages websites.</p>
<p>The website developer can also be retained as the Website administrator but will need to be put on a monthly retainer for this as the cost of building a website does not include continuous website management.</p>
<h4>What Does Search Engine Optimisation Cost?</h4>
<p>This is perhaps the most straightforward one<strong>. The average cost of optimising 10 keywords is between N100,000 and N300,000</strong>. This includes both the on-page and off-page SEO which covers listing, meta tags, PDF submission, Social bookmarking, article promotion, etc. As the number of keywords increases, so does the cost.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that organic SEO is a long-term project and requires between 4-6months of constant work to rank selected keywords. This doesn&#8217;t mean that work stops after 6 months, organic optimisation requires consistent work to reach the first page and stay there.</p>
<p>Now that you have been introduced to the various elements of digital marketing and their cost as stand-alone platforms; the next question is whether you have the personnel in-house to achieve the goal&#8230;and you may then wonder what the cost of getting an Agency on retainer to provide integrated digital marketing services covering all platforms relevant for your brand will be?</p>
<h4>What Does Integrated Digital Marketing Cost?</h4>
<p>Individual digital platforms are great to reach your target audience but to get tangible value out of digital marketing, you need to focus on integrated digital marketing which uses the integrated approach to generate awareness, engage with your prospects, generate leads, and build brand equity.</p>
<p>For example, you want to incorporate Blogging, Social media, Google Ads, Email Marketing, Marketing Automation, Search Engine Optimisation, etc. for your brand.</p>
<p>In this case, you will need an Agency that will dedicate a team with experience in the different areas of digital marketing to manage your brand. Businesses sometimes make the mistake of hiring one person to perform all digital marketing roles &#8211; Content development, design, website management, PPC Management, SEO, etc. <a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/setting-up-your-digital-marketing-team" target="_self" rel="noopener">Check out our blog post on building a digital marketing team here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The average cost for full strategic digital marketing monthly retainership ranges from N800,000 &#8211; N5 million</strong> depending on the scope of work and the number of personnel required to implement it.</p>
<p>In addition to the Agency retainership fee which is paid monthly, you will need to set aside a media budget for third-party platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Yahoo Ads, etc.</p>
<p>You will also need to set aside a budget for marketing software as these are the tools required to implement your <a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/how-to-create-a-digital-marketing-strategy" target="_self" rel="noopener">digital marketing strategy</a>. While there are different software for the different aspects of digital marketing, there are also several full-stack marketing software that covers all areas of marketing and one subscription will take care of your email marketing, Landing page, Chatbots, SEO, PPC, etc. An example of this is <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">HubSpot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The average full-stack marketing software costs between $250 to $5000 depending on the platform, the number of contacts, the number of users, the capability of the platform, etc.</strong></p>
<h4>The Advantages of Digital Marketing</h4>
<p><strong>Budget Flexibility</strong> &#8211; While the costs for the various platforms have been listed, it is important to note that you can decide how much to spend on digital marketing as the budget is very flexible. You can program your Facebook Ads to run for $50 and once the budget is exhausted, the Ad stops.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Time Analytics</strong> &#8211; You can also get real-time analytics which tells you which platform is doing great and which one needs to be fine-tuned or stopped altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Not Dependent on Company Size &#8211; </strong>Implementing Digital Marketing is a fantastic marketing decision irrespective of the business size and industry as it has varied platforms and tactics. A one-man organisation can implement digital marketing just like a 500-man organisation.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past 10 years, marketing has changed dramatically. The ways that companies acquire leads today is very different from how they did so a decade ago. For instance, while having a website was certainly nice, most businesses still prioritized more traditional media, like television, radio, and print ads.</p>
<div class="bd_img"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="696" height="387" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-397" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/traditional-vs-digital-marketing-696x387-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/traditional-vs-digital-marketing-696x387-1.png 696w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/traditional-vs-digital-marketing-696x387-1-300x167.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></div>
<p>Today, establishing a digital presence is central to a business’s success. If you’re still relying on marketing techniques that were popular in 2010, you’re probably not keeping up with your competition. In fact, we’re here to tell you that the hottest marketing strategies of 2019 are already old news. Innovation is no longer a luxury; it’s a necessity.</p>
<p>To get ahead of your competitors in 2020, consider these trends:</p>
<h5>1. Chatbots…</h5>
<p>If your business doesn’t already have a chatbot solution, now’s the time. A <a href="https://marketingland.com/chatbots-could-drive-112-billion-in-retail-sales-by-2023-260767">recent study</a> found that chat bots could drive $112 billion in retail sales by 2023.</p>
<div class="bd_img"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-398" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chatbots.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chatbots.jpeg 800w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chatbots-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chatbots-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></div>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/botsupply/chatbot-101-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-chatbots-478c0b825dd0"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<p>With advances in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, retail sales from chat bots will nearly double annually — but that’s not all. The automation of customer sales and support processes will also deliver significant cost and time savings to retailers.</p>
<h5><strong>2. … And Other AI Technologies</strong></h5>
<p>Smarter chat bots are just one example of how AI is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/08/21/how-artificial-intelligence-is-transforming-digital-marketing/#ca05d6121e1b">revolutionizing the customer journey</a>. Businesses can use AI to optimize marketing campaigns, curate and generate content, and uncover customer insights.</p>
<p>As customers continue to expect quicker response times and instantaneous solutions, leveraging AI is essential to delivering the experience that customers anticipate.</p>
<h5><strong>3. Personalized Advertising</strong></h5>
<p>Customers are bombarded with substantial amounts of new content and information every day, so marketers need to be more creative than ever to get through to them. Providing information or targeting ads based on a customer’s interests, buying habits, and behaviors is one way of doing so. Sending the right message to the right customer is critical.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/ecommerce/web-personalisation/consumers-personalized-marketing-engagement/">SmarterHQ</a>, 72% of consumers reported only engaging with marketing messages that were personalized. To tailor your content, collect user data from surveys or studies so that you can create more relevant campaigns.</p>
<h5><strong>4. Digital Marketing Growth<br />
</strong></h5>
<p>Digital marketing is only going to continue dominating the industry. The <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/11/30/global-digital-marketing-software-industry-set-reach-7496bn-2022">global digital marketing software</a> space is expected to grow from $37 billion in 2017 to $75 billion by 2022 — at which point around 87% of total <a href="https://www.cmo.com.au/article/641955/digital-advertising-continues-dominate-marketing-budgets/">marketing budgets will be digital</a>.</p>
<p>Such growth has brought forth <a href="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/content-marketing/agile-marketing-everything-need-know/">agile marketing</a>, the application of a specific agile methodology to measure, manage, and improve the way a marketing team works. Agile marketing’s deliberate experimentation, commitment to customer satisfaction, and focus on frequent releases signifies a break from traditional marketing.</p>
<h5><strong>5. Single Marketing Software Provider</strong></h5>
<p>With so many digital tools and resources out there, how does a business choose which ones to use? The answer is that they usually don’t choose — the average enterprise deploys an astounding <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2017/06/average-enterprise-uses-91-marketing-cloud-services/">91 marketing cloud services</a>. This could include everything from Slack, Dropbox, and Google Drive to Facebook, Salesforce, and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Switching to <i>one</i> software that manages all of these tools and services is highly beneficial. Customer relationship management (CRM) software like <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot</a> helps reduce repetitive tasks, streamline marketing efforts, improve accountability, and simplify customer management.</p>
<h5><strong>6. Changes to SEO </strong></h5>
<p>Changes in search algorithms are profoundly affecting the search results that a user sees. For instance, since more than <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/google-ctr-in-2018-paid-organic-no-click-searches/">60% of Google’s search results are now zero-click</a>, businesses will need to optimize for <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/333697">on-SERP SEO</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve never heard of zero-click results, but you’ve certainly seen them — these are the search results that Google automatically provides in an automated snippet. For example, if you type in “how to do digital marketing,” Google will generate its own result that is on the top of the first page of the search engine results page (SERP).</p>
<div class="bd_img"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="872" height="913" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-399" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEO.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEO.png 872w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEO-287x300.png 287w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEO-768x804.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" /></div>
<p>With such a reliable result right in “position zero,” users don’t need to check out the organic search or Google Ads results. Your business will need to adjust its SEO strategy accordingly.</p>
<h5><strong>7. Voice-Powered Search</strong></h5>
<p>Search engines are evolving in many more ways, so you’ll need to make other changes to your SEO strategy. Around <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-optimisation-seo/local-seo/what-will-local-seo-look-like-in-2020/">50% of searches in 2020</a> are expected to be voice-based, which will lead to a higher number of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">long-tail keywords</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/25/hyperlocal-marketing">hyperlocal searches</a>. Branded advertising on smart speakers is a great way to take advantage of the voice search phenomenon.</p>
<h5><strong>8. Video Content</strong></h5>
<p><a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/13-types-of-social-media-content-for-your-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content</a> is king, and video is currently in the limelight. In particular, live video will prevail in 2020. <a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2018/03/the-state-of-video-marketing-in-2018.html?zd_source=mta&amp;zd_campaign=11611&amp;zd_term=indrajeetdeshpande">Digital Marketing World</a> predicts that by 2021, 13% of all internet traffic will consist of live video.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare for New Marketing Trends in 2020</strong></p>
<p>Clearly, technology and marketing will go hand-in-hand in 2020.

<p>I don’t know if they teach “Law Firm Marketing” in Law School, nor do I know if they teach “Marketing Engineering Services” in Engineering Faculties.</p>
<p>But one thing stands true, all Professional Services Firms need to be marketed.</p>
<p>Sadly, a lot of Professional Services Firms (Consulting Firms, Engineering Firms, Accounting Firms, Law Firms, Architectural Firms etc) do not invest in marketing.</p>
<p>They see marketing as the exclusive preserve of product brands and rely only on referrals to get #Clients.</p>
<p>Infact, Law Firms and Medical Services Firms (Hospitals, Laboratories, Eye Clinics etc) will argue that they are not allowed to advertise in Nigeria according to the regulatory rules in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Granted. This is true.</p>
<p>But advertising and marketing are two different things. One is a subset of the other, but that is a topic for another day. For now, let’s stick with the business of marketing</p>
<p>While referrals are a good way to generate new leads, they are largely unpredictable and as a business that needs to grow, you need predictable ways to generate leads for your Professional Services Firm.</p>
<p>Also, sticking with referrals alone restricts you to a certain circle of influence and sometimes a specific region.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the buyer journey has changed drastically from what it was years ago. Today, an average buyer will jump online to checkout information and educate himself before he takes a buying decision so why not align your business with the new buyer journey?</p>
<p>If you manage a Professional Services brand and your firm falls within this category, watch this video to learn 3 marketing tips that can help you generate leads for your firm</p>

<h5>HOW TO SET-UP A TOP-NOTCH DIGITAL MARKETING TEAM FOR YOUR ORGANISATION (VIDEO)</h5>
<p>Congratulations! You have recently been hired to lead a business or you are already an MD/CEO/COO of a company and you understand the importance of digital marketing for business growth.</p>
<p>Of course, you need the required personnel to run your digital marketing projects so you ask HR to employ.</p>
<p>Then HR rolls out the job specification below:</p>
<h5>Digital Marketing Executive Job Specification</h5>
<p><strong><em>The successful candidate must be a master of Email Marketing, E-commerce, Social Media Marketing, Content Marketing, Lead generation, Affiliate Marketing, White label &amp; Drop shipping, Landing pages, Copy Writing, Facebook &amp; Google AD, Content creation, Marketing &amp; Online PR, Graphics design, Audience Research &amp; Targeting, A/B Split-Testing, SEO/Copy writing, Technical Writing, Website content, keyword Analysis &amp; Research, Video Marketing, Community management, Sales funnels, Marketing Spend Optimization.</em></strong></p>
<p>Infact, this is an actual Job specification that was shared on LinkedIn by a HR personnel who was recruiting for a firm ?.</p>
<p>With a job specification like this, there is absolutely no way the employee will deliver marketing results!</p>
<p>Digital Marketing requires different skill sets and requires a team of people who have those skills.</p>
<h5>Your Digital Marketing Team Should Consist Of (At Least):</h5>
<ul>
<li>A Digital Graphic Artist</li>
<li>A Content Writer (Having a knowledge of SEO is an added advantage)</li>
<li>A Strategist</li>
<li>A Programmer/Web Developer</li>
</ul>
<p>For low traffic brands, the strategist can also double as the Social Media Manager and can also manage email marketing campaigns, PPC and Marketing automation.</p>
<p>For high traffic brands like e-commerce, there is need to have a different person for other roles like Social Media Manager, PPC Manager, Marketing Automation, Search Engine Optimisation and so on</p>
<h5><strong>If you are looking to get value out of digital marketing, you need a team with the right expertise to get it done.</strong></h5>
<p>You cannot hire one person to write content, design it, share it, respond to comments, schedule marketing automation, edit/build websites, set up PPC campaigns, build landing pages etc.</p>
<p>All of these  require a different set of skills.</p>
<p>It is like hiring one doctor as a Dentist, a Surgeon, A Pediatrician, A dermatologist, An Ophthalmologist, an oncologist and so on.</p>
<p>What outcome do you expect to get from this doctor?</p>
<p>While some businesses may not be able to hire all these persons in house because of the resultant cost, there are two ways you can actually hire a full digital marketing team without breaking the bank.</p>
<h5>TWO WAYS TO HIRE A FULL DIGITAL MARKETING TEAM WITHOUT BREAKING THE BANK</h5>
<h5><strong>Option 1 &#8211; Work With A Digital Marketing Agency</strong></h5>
<p>Hire a Brand Manager who sits in house and works with a Digital Marketing Agency to get things done. Your Brand Manager can serve as your strategist, He/she will develop strategies and briefs in collaboration with the Agency Strategist. Once approved by the management team, the Agency executes the brief with its team of Content Writers, Artists, Programmers, PPC Specialists, Community Managers etc.</p>
<h5><strong>What Are The Advantages of Working With An Agency Team?</strong></h5>
<p>1. <strong>It is cost effective</strong>. You get the full marketing team working on your brand but only get to pay a part of their salaries since the Agency team is a shared team.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Less Errors</strong>. Your brand gets to benefit from several Agency checks and balances put in place to reduce error margins.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2 &#8211; Work With Freelancers</strong></p>
<p>You hire a brand manager who works with a team of freelancers with the needed skills to get the job done.</p>
<p>One challenge you may experience with this option is the lack of ownership and accountability from freelancers as they usually have a project mindset and are not concerned with the long term benefits of the brand.</p>
<p><strong>Taking A Decision</strong></p>
<p>Whichever option you chose to go with largely depends on your brand and what you are looking to achieve with marketing.</p>
<p>Hiring one person to manage the full digital marketing for your firm amounts to hiring an octopus, and nine times out of ten, it is guaranteed to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Looking to x-ray your business to see which option is a good fit?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Watch Video &#8211; 5 Best Practices For Winning With Email Marketing</strong></p>
<p>Most Business Owners and Brand custodians cringe when they hear Email Marketing. They have been victims of SPAM emails themselves and they simply have no interest in Spamming anyone with their own company mails.</p>
<p>I understand these fears. A lot of Nigerian Marketers abuse the email marketing medium. They buy email addresses from willing vendors and simply spam every Tom, Dick and Harry with their email blast.</p>
<p>However, when professionally and properly used, Email marketing works and still remains one of the most effective digital marketing medium.</p>
<p>The most important role of the email marketing medium is to nurture Prospects into becoming Clients. It is not for you to disturb them and get them to dislike your brand.</p>
<h5>Here are 5 Best Practices for using Email Marketing</h5>
<p>1. Only send emails to people who subscribed, or willingly gave their email addresses in exchange for a download or an offer.  Since they already have prior relationship with you, they are more at ease when they see your mail compared to when they have no relationship with you whatsoever.</p>
<p>It is extremely unprofessional to buy email addresses and then send email blasts. It is like barging into a stranger’s house without prior relationship with the person nor an invitation.</p>
<p>2. Reduce the frequency of emails. Even if someone gives you an invitation to their house by way of subscribing, they don’t expect you to knock on their doors every day. They expect you to show some decorum and allow them their privacy. It is the same thing with email.<br />
You don’t send emails everyday because someone subscribed. Infact, companies who have had great success with email marketing space out the timing of their mails.</p>
<p>3. Your emails should help solve a pain point. Your emails should not focus on selling, selling, selling. It should help solve a pain point for the recipient of the mail. For example, If your company is in the Power Engineering sector, how about sending an email that helps people calculate the number of Watts that they need to run their homes?</p>
<p>4. Your emails should be relevant to the target audience: Do not send an email on 10 Ways to Dispose a diaper to an 80-year-old man. While the information does help to solve a pain point, chances that an 80-year-old man will need this information is very slim.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why you shouldn’t even consider buying email addresses. Because you do not know whose email address you are buying.</p>
<p>5. Your emails should follow a sequence that aligns with your marketing funnel. Don’t just send random emails because the information contained therein is relevant, send emails in line with your marketing funnel so that at the end of the sequence, you are able to guide the recipient to take desired action.</p>
<p>Your email marketing should be drawn out in a strategy with each email working with the next to achieve the overall objective.</p>
<p>Email marketing can generate leads for your firms if you apply it professionally and align it with your marketing funnel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a Brand or Marketing Manager, it is extremely important to develop a Digital Marketing Strategy for your brand. A strategy holds your Digital Marketing Communications together just as the skeleton holds the human body together. Your marketing success and indeed business growth depends largely on drawing up a solid and effective digital marketing strategy that can be implemented realistically.</p>
<h5>Here’s Why You Need a Digital Marketing Strategy</h5>
<p>Your Digital Marketing Strategy is a compass that directs your marketing efforts. It helps you to:</p>
<p>1. Make informed decision</p>
<p>2. Measure your marketing efforts</p>
<p>3. Focus on the important elements</p>
<p>4. Develop a marketing budget</p>
<p>While most brand custodians understand the need to develop a digital marketing strategy for their brand, their challenge has mainly been how to develop one and knowing the various elements that a good digital marketing strategy should contain.<br />
If you find yourself in this category or you simply need more information to augment what you have developed, here is a detailed outline of How to develop a digital marketing strategy and a Digital Marketing Strategy Template to go with this plan.</p>
<h5>Elements of a Digital Marketing Strategy</h5>
<h5>1.  Industry Review</h5>
<p>Briefly review the industry your brand plays in while noting the relevant development that has hit the market in the recent times. Then review how this development will affect your brand and its marketing while also noting opportunities that you can latch on to. You can use the PESTEL Model for this evaluation (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and legal)</p>
<h5>2. Business/Brand Review</h5>
<p>Develop a SWOT analysis of your brand to understand the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. This will help you direct marketing efforts to address your weaknesses, amplify your strengths, advise relevant departments to handle the opportunities and threats.</p>
<p>In this age when things move fast, it is important to analyse a brand’s SWOT analysis from time to time as what may stand as your strength today may change in a couple of months and vice versa.</p>
<h5>3. Goals and Objectives</h5>
<p>Know what you want to achieve and set objectives accordingly.  Define your business’ overall marketing goal first, then list out your marketing objectives in clear and easily understood language.  Ensure that they are measurable and align with your metrics which will feature in the latter part of this outline.</p>
<p><em><strong>For example;</strong></em></p>
<p>Create top of mind awareness amongst target audience in Nigeria by getting 2million impressions across channels monthl</p>
<p>Drive traffic to the company’s website to achieve 400,000 visitors monthly</p>
<p>Generate 150 leads monthly across channels.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>SMART model</strong> to evaluate your objectives to know if you are on the right track. This model simply states that your objectives must be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time-bound.</p>
<h5>4. Identify Your Target Audience and Develop a Buyer Persona</h5>
<p>It’s important to know your audience well and understand that they are the heart of your strategy or else your marketing efforts will be ineffective. You must understand their pain points and seek to help them solve it using relevant strategies.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to create a Buyer Persona for your brand. A brand can have one or more buyer personas, depending on elaborate its target audience are.</p>
<p><em><strong>For example:</strong></em></p>
<p>A brand like MTN will have its target audience from 18 – 60 years old. While this may form a broad target audience, it is impossible to have one marketing message that will appeal to this varied audience and their pain points will be extremely different.</p>
<p>In this case, they can then be broken into segments using Age, Socio-Economic class, Education etc. and a Buyer Persona developed for each of these segments to effectively address their pain points.</p>
<p>Looking to learn more about developing a Buyer Persona and a template to go with it, check our earlier post on <strong><a href="https://www.zizadigital.com/how-to-create-a-buyer-persona-for-your-brand/">How to create a buyer persona for your brand</a>.</strong></p>
<h5>5. Select Your Digital Marketing Tactics and Platforms</h5>
<p>The tactics are the specific approaches that you will deploy to meet your marketing objectives along with the platform that will support that approach.</p>
<p>There are different Digital Marketing tactics and the major goals that each one can help to achieve.</p>
<p><strong><em>For example:</em></strong></p>
<p>Display Advertising works best for awareness, Customer Acquisition and Brand Building. So, if your objective is to engage with prospects and current Clients, then Display Advertising is not a relevant tactic for this.</p>
<p>Also, you need to decide on the content format. What content format will you put up on your digital channels. Videos are here to stay and are the rave of the moment so it is advisable to have lots of video content. Even an article can be summarized into a 1-minute video.</p>
<p>It is best to have a mix of content types so as not to bore people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zizadigital.com/digital-marketing-resources/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-434" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Download-Template.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Download-Template.png 600w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Download-Template-300x100.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In selecting the right tactics and platforms, here are the elements that should influence this decision:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Buyer Persona Profile</strong> – If your target audience is a 17-year-old guy that hangs out on Snapchat, you are better of with videos compared to developing E-books and/or  Whitepapers</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Objectives</strong> – If you want to grow sales by X number, Search Ads will be a better option compared to Social Media engagement</p>
<p><strong>The Industry</strong> – For example, LinkedIn is more relevant for B2B brands compared to Instagram.</p>
<h5>6. Metrics</h5>
<p>Set realistic and measurable KPIs.  Be very specific with your KPIs by identifying the metrics you’ll use in measuring performance. Clearly articulate what each digital channel is trying to achieve. Then make sure you have at least one KPI attached to each of your digital channels.</p>
<p>Some metrics to use include, Number of leads generated, conversion rate, number of social media followers, social media engagement rate, number of content downloads, number of new visitors to the website etc.</p>
<p>Then Identify a method or software to help you measure each of your KPIs – for example, Use Google Analytics to measure conversion rate?</p>
<p>Before you begin planning your KPIs find out which metrics matter most to your CEO or the company’s board.</p>
<h5>7. Budget</h5>
<p>Marketing costs money so be sure to have a budget that adequately covers the tactics laid out and ensure that your budget matches your marketing objectives.</p>
<p><strong><em>For example;</em></strong></p>
<p>Your goal might be to increase Facebook likes by 20,000 in one week and your budget is 500 Naira. This is surely going to be difficult.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to include the cost of tools/software subscription, manpower (You may need to get a freelancer to write your content or hire a Graphic Artist, or even a full-scale Agency), post sponsorship, design etc.</p>
<p>Now you have your Digital Marketing Strategy ready for review with your management team and implementation thereafter.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that marketing is fluid and things keep changing. Customer preferences change rapidly and new platforms and tools are introduced, the brand /marketing manager should keep abreast of the industry and make relevant edits on the strategy document where the needs arise.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, those edits must align with the business goals of the firm and the marketing objectives respectively.</p>
