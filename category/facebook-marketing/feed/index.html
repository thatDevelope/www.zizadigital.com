]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is one big marketplace with only one product on display; Content.</p>
<p>Without consistent doses of this, social media is as good as dead. In a marketplace, saturated with only one kind of product, variety is important for the survival of brands marketing their products and services on these platforms.</p>
<p>On social media, your content has to be creative, engaging, relevant and consistent.</p>
<p>This list will help you diversify your content formats making it easier to put up quality content consistently and also show you what platforms are best suited for each content type.</p>
<h5>1. Videos [Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, Vine]</h5>
<p>Videos are the rave of the moment right now, especially on Facebook. As long as you have a great brand story to tell, videos are your best bet for getting your message across effectively.</p>
<p>A good video will give your brand better engagement and CTRs and there are lots of tools online that let you make videos ranging from gifs to animations and full HD.</p>
<p>In addition to these types of videos, you can stream videos to a live audience on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter! In fact, Videos are certainly a great way to create content.</p>
<h5>2. Infographics [Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest]</h5>
<p>Infographics are a graphical representation of information. According to Content Desk, an infographic is 30 times more likely to be read than a pure text article.</p>
<p>This gives your content a different feel altogether, it displays all you need to discuss in one glance. It’s a very effective way of creating content for your social media pages because your readers are able to digest large information in small memorable chunks. Again, there are a lot of free tools for making great infographic and one of them is Canva. They are easy to use and work wonders for your social media engagement.</p>
<h5>3. Questionnaires or Quiz [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>There is no doubt that questionnaires and quizzes are an audience engagement magnet. They foster a conversation between a content creator and a content consumer (Which is ideal because social media is about connecting). Questionnaires are a good way to also get feedback on products and services offered by your brand to improve or create something entirely new.</p>
<p>Quizzes are a good way to make your content go viral because they’re fun and people love to show off how much they know so they’ll be more likely to share it with family and friends.</p>
<h5>4. Podcasts [Facebook, Twitter]</h5>
<p>The rise of smart mobile devices has made the use of podcast become a fast and convenient way of creating content for social media pages.</p>
<p>Podcasts humanizes your brand and gives it a voice and some personality. This is good for building trust and encouraging engagement, but might not be suitable for every brand.</p>
<h5>5. Slideshows and Pictures [Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat]</h5>
<p>Slides, pictures, and infographic help to break down bulky content into smaller bits and focus on one idea at a time. You can use Microsoft PowerPoint to convert your content to slides and share on your social media pages.</p>
<p>You can also use products like Slideshare on LinkedIn and Slide boom to convert your PowerPoint presentation to flash for easy sharing. For pictures, get HD quality pictures from sites like Pexels, Unsplash Isorepublic etc. and edit them to your taste using Canva or any other free online picture editor.</p>
<h5>6. &#8220;How to&#8221; Type of Content for (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest)</h5>
<p>A significant demand for information has driven the “how to” type of content into one of the most read type of content on social media.</p>
<p>With a significant increase in demand for information, “how-to” type of content is so popular that it can be in any format and still attract an audience.</p>
<p>When writing, give practical and useful information that helps your audience achieve their goals in real time.</p>
<p>Find out the major pain points of your audience and help them solve it in a step-by-step guide. They will happily engage with your content.</p>
<h5>7. Create Lists [Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest]</h5>
<p>Like “how to” type of content, Lists are also a popular type of content.</p>
<p>In a world where the average attention span is 3 seconds, lists are a great way to pass across important or useful information in seconds.</p>
<p>Examples of such type of content are: 10 fruits that are grown in only one part of the world, 15 top financial institutions in the world, and so on. Once you pick a good topic and pick a number, your list is halfway done. Create a list on your social media pages and watch it work its magic.</p>
<h5>8. Use Links [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>On social media, people prefer information to be as brief as possible. So to get people to read your long-form content, put it in a blog on your website, then share the links to your social media pages. You could also curate content from other websites that are useful and relevant to your audience and share them as links on your social media pages.</p>
<h5>9. E-books [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>This is a long content packaged in a different format, usually as a PDF or epub file. E-books help strengthen your authority within a field, and it is a powerful method of sharing your content with others. E-books are downloadable and offer a brilliant avenue to generate leads and capture information about website visitors.</p>
<h5>10. Interview [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>Face-to-face interviews are a great way to create content.  You give your audience a unique insight into a topic when you interview professionals, ordinary people on the street or other people of interest in any field and on any topic. It can be in Video or Long Content format, just be sure it’s relevant and rich in quality to your audience.</p>
<h5>11. Research [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>Research makes you an authority and expert in your field. When you do the hard work and get it right, people who need your findings will always reference you when they quote your work and include backlinks to your website.</p>
<p>Doing research is very time-consuming though but always worth it especially when your research is thorough and of high quality. The findings of your research can be converted to any format for easy distribution across social media platforms.</p>
<h5>12. Reviews [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube]</h5>
<p>Reviews are great and are a highly sought after form of content if you’re in some type of industry like the tech industry. People like to do research before purchasing any product online and a positive review helps them make informed decisions. Products and services in any industry can be reviewed. So help buyers make better decisions when purchasing by writing product reviews.</p>
<h5>13. Pure Text [Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn]</h5>
<p>This is the use of text alone (letters) to disseminate information. All you need do is get creative with your writing. Tell stories, everyone loves a good story. Ensure the beginning of your text is captivating enough to get your audience to read through to the end. Most importantly, be as brief as you possibly can. Use suspense and mystery to get them to come back for more.</p>
<p>Finally, to grow your fan-base and increase engagement on your social media page you must know your audience, how they think, their habits, and online routines. When that is fully understood, you can now choose the best way(s) to reach them.</p>
