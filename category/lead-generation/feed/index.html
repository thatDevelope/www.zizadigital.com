										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lead generation is the process of attracting strangers and prospects into your business’ contact management system, with the aim of making them instant or future customers.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, engagement and sales have most likely slowed down for your brand, for some businesses, it is actually non-existent. Several experts have predicted that there is likely to be a recession post-COVID-19. Some have gone on to say that there may be a devaluation of currencies, a hike in inflation rates and a total market shakeup. With predictions like these, businesses are on the tip of their chairs and are wondering, what next post Covid-19? What are the salient things we need to implement to help us weather the storm?</p>
<p>Chances are you will need to generate new leads for a fast and powerful comeback. Wipe those sweat beads, we’ve got you. Below are seven tested-and-true lead magnets that will fetch your business hot leads post the COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
<h5>1. Value-adding Videos</h5>
<p>HubSpot reports that customers are four times more likely to click on a video than read about a product, and 52% of marketers around the world name video as the content with the best ROI.</p>
<p>Make a short video- how to…, a DIY, or one showcasing fancy ways to use your product. The agenda is to tackle a problem or create value for a prospect. Provided he/she learns something useful from your site or social media page, the next time they have a need related to the service you provide, they are most likely to head your way, and depending on what this need might be, they will be ready and willing to convert.</p>
<p>You can also try the initial 2-3 minutes for free to get them hooked, and then ask them to drop an email address to continue watching.</p>
<h5>Cheatsheets</h5>
<p>Cheat sheets are simple and concise guides proffering insights on how a task might be carried out. They are similar to e-books but only more comprehensive, as all the focus is on how to perform an action. No schooling on why it should be done, nothing ambiguous or time-consuming, just the best and quickest way to get it done.</p>
<p>Potential formats for cheat sheets might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step-by-step guides on particular tasks (e.g. How to setup a chat bot on your website)</li>
<li>Templates (e.g.,<a href="https://www.zizadigital.com/how-to-create-a-digital-marketing-strategy/"> How to develop a digital marketing strategy (template included, Tax Calculation Template)</a></li>
<li>Checklists (e.g., Content promotion checklist)</li>
</ul>
<h5>3. Downloadable Content</h5>
<p>The good thing about downloadable content is that they are super affordable and easy to create. In fact, it is as easy as converting one of your blog posts into a pdf and position it as a lead magnet. You just have to stick to the premium rule: offer value. Keep in mind the stage of the and the need for you to offer real insights. If someone gives you their contact information, it’s only fair you provide some good enough value in return. Besides, lead generation is only a part of your grand marketing plan. Without a convincing reason to ride with you, they most likely will leave the sales funnel, which I’m sure is not something you are enthusiastic to see happen.</p>
<h5>4. Trial period</h5>
<p>It is not uncommon to find prospects adamant to convert until they have confirmed a product or service is right for them. For such potential customers, a trial tames their fears.</p>
<p>This is also a grand opportunity for you to strategically make your service one so valuable they can’t or don’t want to live without.</p>
<h5>Discounts</h5>
<p>A good deal is always an easy way to get lead traffic. I mean, who doesn&#8217;t smile at the sight of a discounted offer? The bottom line is everyone appreciates a deal. Therefore, placing a discount on products/services you offer can be a great way to push someone over the edge not only into sharing their contact information with you, but also to stick with you if not for your great services, for future discounts and promotions.</p>
<h5>Quizzes</h5>
<p>How many times have you clicked on a quiz to figure out how well your friends know you or what you would look like with a different colour of hair on?</p>
<p>Provided you are able to tie them to your brand, quizzes can be a fun way to engage your audience and scoop leads.</p>
<p>This kind of lead generation tactic can bring a wealth of resourceful insight into your overall inbound marketing activities.</p>
<h5>7. Host a giveaway</h5>
<p>Giveaways are one of the chief most successful lead generation practices of all time. Indisputable is the fact that it is a popular way to generate a bunch of stale leads that do not benefit your business, but if properly carried out, chances of this happening can be greatly minimized.</p>
<p>The secret recipe is to ensure that what you&#8217;re giving away is something people actually want; something of value that relates to your line of business.</p>
<p>A giveaway generates leads via social media engagement and email subscriptions, which is a win-win for you and your prospects. On the bright side, it doesn’t matter so much if a user wins or loses the giveaway, they will continue to engage with your brand in hopes of getting lucky enough to win future giveaways.</p>
