										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past 10 years, marketing has changed dramatically. The ways that companies acquire leads today is very different from how they did so a decade ago. For instance, while having a website was certainly nice, most businesses still prioritized more traditional media, like television, radio, and print ads.</p>
<div class="bd_img"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="696" height="387" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-397" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/traditional-vs-digital-marketing-696x387-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/traditional-vs-digital-marketing-696x387-1.png 696w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/traditional-vs-digital-marketing-696x387-1-300x167.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></div>
<p>Today, establishing a digital presence is central to a business’s success. If you’re still relying on marketing techniques that were popular in 2010, you’re probably not keeping up with your competition. In fact, we’re here to tell you that the hottest marketing strategies of 2019 are already old news. Innovation is no longer a luxury; it’s a necessity.</p>
<p>To get ahead of your competitors in 2020, consider these trends:</p>
<h5>1. Chatbots…</h5>
<p>If your business doesn’t already have a chatbot solution, now’s the time. A <a href="https://marketingland.com/chatbots-could-drive-112-billion-in-retail-sales-by-2023-260767">recent study</a> found that chat bots could drive $112 billion in retail sales by 2023.</p>
<div class="bd_img"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-398" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chatbots.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chatbots.jpeg 800w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chatbots-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chatbots-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></div>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/botsupply/chatbot-101-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-chatbots-478c0b825dd0"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<p>With advances in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, retail sales from chat bots will nearly double annually — but that’s not all. The automation of customer sales and support processes will also deliver significant cost and time savings to retailers.</p>
<h5><strong>2. … And Other AI Technologies</strong></h5>
<p>Smarter chat bots are just one example of how AI is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/08/21/how-artificial-intelligence-is-transforming-digital-marketing/#ca05d6121e1b">revolutionizing the customer journey</a>. Businesses can use AI to optimize marketing campaigns, curate and generate content, and uncover customer insights.</p>
<p>As customers continue to expect quicker response times and instantaneous solutions, leveraging AI is essential to delivering the experience that customers anticipate.</p>
<h5><strong>3. Personalized Advertising</strong></h5>
<p>Customers are bombarded with substantial amounts of new content and information every day, so marketers need to be more creative than ever to get through to them. Providing information or targeting ads based on a customer’s interests, buying habits, and behaviors is one way of doing so. Sending the right message to the right customer is critical.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/ecommerce/web-personalisation/consumers-personalized-marketing-engagement/">SmarterHQ</a>, 72% of consumers reported only engaging with marketing messages that were personalized. To tailor your content, collect user data from surveys or studies so that you can create more relevant campaigns.</p>
<h5><strong>4. Digital Marketing Growth<br />
</strong></h5>
<p>Digital marketing is only going to continue dominating the industry. The <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/11/30/global-digital-marketing-software-industry-set-reach-7496bn-2022">global digital marketing software</a> space is expected to grow from $37 billion in 2017 to $75 billion by 2022 — at which point around 87% of total <a href="https://www.cmo.com.au/article/641955/digital-advertising-continues-dominate-marketing-budgets/">marketing budgets will be digital</a>.</p>
<p>Such growth has brought forth <a href="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/content-marketing/agile-marketing-everything-need-know/">agile marketing</a>, the application of a specific agile methodology to measure, manage, and improve the way a marketing team works. Agile marketing’s deliberate experimentation, commitment to customer satisfaction, and focus on frequent releases signifies a break from traditional marketing.</p>
<h5><strong>5. Single Marketing Software Provider</strong></h5>
<p>With so many digital tools and resources out there, how does a business choose which ones to use? The answer is that they usually don’t choose — the average enterprise deploys an astounding <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2017/06/average-enterprise-uses-91-marketing-cloud-services/">91 marketing cloud services</a>. This could include everything from Slack, Dropbox, and Google Drive to Facebook, Salesforce, and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Switching to <i>one</i> software that manages all of these tools and services is highly beneficial. Customer relationship management (CRM) software like <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot</a> helps reduce repetitive tasks, streamline marketing efforts, improve accountability, and simplify customer management.</p>
<h5><strong>6. Changes to SEO </strong></h5>
<p>Changes in search algorithms are profoundly affecting the search results that a user sees. For instance, since more than <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/google-ctr-in-2018-paid-organic-no-click-searches/">60% of Google’s search results are now zero-click</a>, businesses will need to optimize for <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/333697">on-SERP SEO</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve never heard of zero-click results, but you’ve certainly seen them — these are the search results that Google automatically provides in an automated snippet. For example, if you type in “how to do digital marketing,” Google will generate its own result that is on the top of the first page of the search engine results page (SERP).</p>
<div class="bd_img"><img decoding="async" width="872" height="913" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-399" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEO.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEO.png 872w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEO-287x300.png 287w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEO-768x804.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" /></div>
<p>With such a reliable result right in “position zero,” users don’t need to check out the organic search or Google Ads results. Your business will need to adjust its SEO strategy accordingly.</p>
<h5><strong>7. Voice-Powered Search</strong></h5>
<p>Search engines are evolving in many more ways, so you’ll need to make other changes to your SEO strategy. Around <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-optimisation-seo/local-seo/what-will-local-seo-look-like-in-2020/">50% of searches in 2020</a> are expected to be voice-based, which will lead to a higher number of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">long-tail keywords</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/25/hyperlocal-marketing">hyperlocal searches</a>. Branded advertising on smart speakers is a great way to take advantage of the voice search phenomenon.</p>
<h5><strong>8. Video Content</strong></h5>
<p><a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/13-types-of-social-media-content-for-your-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content</a> is king, and video is currently in the limelight. In particular, live video will prevail in 2020. <a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2018/03/the-state-of-video-marketing-in-2018.html?zd_source=mta&amp;zd_campaign=11611&amp;zd_term=indrajeetdeshpande">Digital Marketing World</a> predicts that by 2021, 13% of all internet traffic will consist of live video.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare for New Marketing Trends in 2020</strong></p>
