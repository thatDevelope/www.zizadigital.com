										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Marketing</h5>
<p>Your professional services firm is most on the path to failure or indefinite struggle without a marketing strategy. Nevertheless, the presence of one does not guarantee success. There are a number of actions prone to endangering your brand perception, as well as negatively impacting your ROI.</p>
<p>In working with several professional services firms across Nigeria, we have identified 5 marketing mistakes that are common with these firms. Read on to learn these five mistakes and how to avoid them in your own organisation.</p>
<h5>1. Not having a dedicated marketing team:</h5>
<p>Professional Services firms often run marketing as an extension of the MD&#8217;s desk. This means that there is no dedicated marketing staff or team to do mind the task. In its stead is an MD who implements marketing tactics at his convenience and mostly in piece meals as he neither has the time nor the expertise to implement strategic marketing communications for the firm.</p>
<p>One implication of this is that the value gained from marketing in this kind of firm will be next to nothing and as time goes on, the MD might be inclined to think that marketing doesn&#8217;t achieve results. The budget invested in marketing in a firm like this will be wasted.</p>
<p>Another consequence is that if the firm has a strong competition that is focused on consistent marketing with a desk of dedicated and strong marketing professionals, it will only be a matter of time before the competitor overtakes the firm.</p>
<h5>2. Long approval process:</h5>
<p>This is especially true for firms that do not have a dedicated marketing team. The aftermath of which being the approval process for marketing projects will be tedious and hard as there is no one consciously looking out for these projects. Besides, professional services firms are conservative in nature and have long approval processes.</p>
<p>Marketing, on the other hand, moves at the speed of light and long approval processes may hinder marketing campaigns or projects that are time-sensitive; especially consumer-generated campaigns based on latest industry news or trends, some of which have potency of between one day to one week.</p>
<p>Waiting for the admin to pass it to the GM’s Secretary/PA who then has to weigh the importance and then presents it to the GM when other priorities have given way, which may be two weeks later and no longer relevant at that time.</p>
<h5>3. Treating marketing as an afterthought:</h5>
<p>Most professional service firms do not make allowance for marketing while planning for their firms. It is often treated as an afterthought and receives almost no attention.</p>
<p>This is a mistake that any firm looking to gain relevance and thrive should have no hands in.</p>
<p>Brands often make the mistake of treating marketing only as an afterthought to be looked into when it seems they are way in over their heads and are struggling to keep afloat. Implementing marketing only when the organisation has challenges only puts pressure on marketing to focus on short term goals and tactics like promos, price slash etc.</p>
<h5>4. Not implementing marketing as a long-term project:</h5>
<p>A number of the professional services firms that invest in marketing do so on an ad-hoc basis. They implement a project once in two years and for a short period of time and never consider it again until a distant future. Meanwhile, marketing is supposed to be a huge part of your everyday project in running the organisation.</p>
<p>In one study, it was found that all that is needed to put off a potential client is one moment of dissatisfaction usually from lack of service, speed of return on assignments, lack of insight or experience in a specific sector; all of which is an action inconsistent marketing projects promote.</p>
<p>Like I always say, marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. It is actually never done.</p>
<h5>5. Lack of marketing budget:</h5>
<p>Having things in motion to create content is only the first step. Even more important is the need to strategically have it appear in front of the right audience via hyper-targeted promotions.</p>
<p>For a firm where marketing was not planned for in the first place, there is almost always no budget set aside for it. Without an active budget, nothing gets implemented.</p>
<p>To quote Stuart H. Britt, &#8220;Doing business without advertising is like winking at a girl in the dark. You know what you&#8217;re doing, but nobody else does.&#8221;</p>
<p>You need a marketing budget where your marketing team can periodically dip their hands into to promote your firm’s content to garner the right amount and type of website traffic and leads that will fill your funnel and grow your business.</p>
<p>To correct this mistake, consider including a marketing budget to your firm’s annual budget, to be channeled towards paid advertising like Google Pay-Per-Click (PPC), search engine marketing (SEM) or LinkedIn/other social media sponsored updates are a great way to get your content before the right ‘eyeballs’ as you&#8217;re building your organic audience.</p>
<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
<p>Developing a marketing strategy is vital for the survival and growth of any business. Without one, your efforts to attract and retain customers are likely to be hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>With an effective marketing plan in place, you’ll be able to straighten out such things as who your actual customers are versus who you thought they were, potential new growth opportunities, make viable marketing investments, and avoid these five plus other marketing mistakes that could hurt your firm’s lead generation opportunities and brand reputation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building a loyal and engaging social media audience is hard work but nonetheless every business’ dream.</p>
<p>But what happens when you put in all the required effort and still don’t get the results you really want?</p>
<p>Here’s how to tell your social media strategy is faulty and how to fix it.</p>
<h5><b>1. Your Community Is Not Expanding</b></h5>
<p>The number one reason a brand should be active on social media is to build a vibrant and engaged community of people who love and are loyal to your brand to the point where they will willingly recommend you to family and friends.</p>
<p>In this case, number matters. But it isn’t always equal to quality; which is what you should be aiming for. For example, 1,000 actively engaged followers are more valuable to your brand than 100,000 followers who ignore and never engage with your content online.</p>
<p>However, if your community of followers and fans isn’t increasing consistently then something is wrong.</p>
<h5><b>The Fix</b></h5>
<p>Reach out to more people who match your ideal audience (organically or through ads) and Interact with THEIR content to make them notice you.</p>
<h5><b>2. Low Engagement Rates</b></h5>
<p>One of your brand’s marketing goals should be to be so connected to your ideal target audience that you understand deeply and are able to predict their needs in real time. This transforms your content creation strategy because you can then create content to match every step of their buyer’s journey.</p>
<p>But, if the above is missing, your content becomes boring or irrelevant, and your followers will have zero motivation to engage with it. Try to understand what your audience needs and tweak your strategy accordingly.</p>
<h5><b>The Fix</b></h5>
<p>It’s no news that Instagram and Facebook have cut organic reach to the barest minimum, and there are rumors that Twitter will soon follow suit. So you have to pay for the exposure you once enjoyed for free that brought you most of your current followers.</p>
<p>If you can’t afford ads right now, you can beat the algorithm by doubling your content marketing efforts. Put up posts that strike a chord, spark an emotion in the reader to entice them to engage and more importantly SHARE your content willingly.</p>
<h5><b>3. The Wrong Audience is Contacting You</b></h5>
<p>When putting up content on social media, you do so with a specific target audience in mind; people who will be interested enough to interact positively with it.</p>
<p>So when the only engagement you’re getting is from bots who leave spam comments and likes or the people interacting with your content and contacting you are not your ideal target audience then something is wrong with your marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Your branding isn’t coming across clearly and you may be targeting the wrong audience mistakenly (e.g. using the wrong hashtags) or out of error on your part (creating content that is too generic or of very little value).</p>
<h5><b>The Fix</b></h5>
<p>Define your target audience clearly. When in doubt, check your competitors account and see who is following and interacting with their content and what posts got the most engagement.</p>
<p>Define the goals you want to achieve with each piece of content and make your content more specific and practical.</p>
<p>Post with a purpose, address common pain points of your audience, inform and educate them.</p>
<h5><b>4. You Slowly but Consistently Lose Followers</b></h5>
<p>When some brands first start out, they either buy fake followers or follow just about any and everybody in order to push their numbers up because like it or not, numbers still matter and people still use it to rate your brand before following and eventually doing business with you.</p>
<p>But brands who begin like this soon realize that there’s no shortcut to social media success, because even though they have large followings, there’s very little engagement and conversion. To make matters worse,  they start loosing followers after a while.</p>
<p>This happens because, fake accounts are constantly being shut down and deleted and the crowd you zealously followed at first may not be interested in your brand and content so they leave quickly and quietly.</p>
<h5><b>The Fix</b></h5>
<p>If you’ve done the above, it can be salvaged. Start now to build your ideal audience from scratch, only follow and engage with people who match your ideal target audience. Then create content they would love and share with family and friends.</p>
<h5><b>5. When You Run a Social Media Contest and The Only Participants Are Your Own Employees/Family Members</b></h5>
<p>When you run contests and giveaways and no one is bothering to participate except your own staff, family and friends then something is wrong.</p>
<p>Contests and giveaways often serve as free publicity for your brand because most of them require participants to share and tag people to something. To pull this off effectively, you, therefore, need a sizeable and engaged audience who love your brand enough to contest for your product or service.</p>
<h5><b>The Fix</b></h5>
<p>Run Social Media Ads.</p>
<p>If no one is participating in your competitions, it’s time to get fresh eyes on your content.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when brands could get away with relying strictly on organic engagement so get used to the idea of spending money for promotions to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>Social Media platforms are brands that need to make money too. A huge advantage though is that they provide you the cheapest and most specific way to reach and engage with your target audience.</p>
<h5><b>In the end…</b></h5>
<p>It is important to understand that the <b>PRIMARY AIM</b> of Social Media is to engage with clients/customers and prospects and build a vibrant community. While Social Media may bring in Clients, do not make your Social Media page a sales page where all you do is to sell. This will bore your followers and perhaps even get them to unfollow you quietly.</p>
<p>Social Media can be beneficial if done professionally with the right mix of content that can add value to your followers. It can help to build brand perception, create a community of loyalists and even bring in Clients.  In order to ensure the success of Social Media Marketing, have a strategy in place and implement it with the best tools and people.</p>
