										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever bounced out of a website?</p>
<p>Was it because the content wasn&#8217;t helpful? Or something else?</p>
<p>Think about those interesting pieces of content that kept you glued till you got to the comment section and got you feeling like; &#8220;Phew&#8221; I need more &#8220;What a piece of content!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, I have been there too.</p>
<p>Let me ask you&#8230;</p>
<p>Did you enjoy the article because of the degree of relevancy and expertise shown in the content? Or is there more to it?</p>
<p>&#8220;There should be more to it than just the content.&#8221; you are wondering, right?</p>
<p>The simple truth is, there is more!</p>
<p>Great content writers have found this and have mastered the art of using it to keep their readers glued to their articles.</p>
<p>The fact is that these experts don&#8217;t just write they &#8220;CONNECT&#8221;</p>
<p>You will agree with me that once you find unique content that you can connect with easily, It encourages you to read till the end</p>
<p>Bloggers use these bridge-phrases to add conversational value that not only grabs your attention but makes the article more like you are having a conversation!</p>
<p>This technique is so magnetic hence, you become so attached to the page that it becomes your go-to website for that topic of interest.</p>
<p>If your readers can connect, they will certainly come back for more and this, in turn, will attract more people -And of course, this is great for SEO (Thanks to google). You get ORGANIC TRAFFIC.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s this technique?</p>
<p>It is called the &#8220;BUCKET BRIGADE&#8221;.</p>
<p>Huh!<br />
Yes, I know you are wondering what this is, hold on, permit me to walk you through.</p>
<h5>What does the term Bucket Brigade mean?</h5>
<p>Bucket Brigades are intentional bridge words or phrases used by writers to hook the reader to keep reading. It encourages you to go on and on till the end of the article.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question.<br />
Have you ever come across these words in any content you read recently?</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about it for a minute</li>
<li>I know the feeling</li>
<li>Ok, I know what you are thinking.</li>
<li>Now, look, this is crazy!</li>
<li>Want to know the best part?</li>
<li>What’s the bottom line?</li>
<li>Here’s the deal</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s jump right at it!</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t stop there,</li>
<li>Here is why</li>
<li>Nevertheless</li>
<li>Can you imagine?</li>
<li>No problem!</li>
<li>Let me show you how……</li>
</ul>
<p>These words are called bucket brigades. They are used to smoothen the flow of content and to add conversational value. This writing technique is also known as the grease slide techniques</p>
<p>Like superglue, bloggers use these words as often as they write. They have mastered this act of using them strategically to keep you stuck to their pieces of content.<br />
That&#8217;s why knowing how to apply these techniques is the most important part. These will help you keep the flow when you write content and keep the reader sliding through till the end of your article.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h5>Professional content writers use these connectors in 3 stages:</h5>
<p>1. The Introduction<br />
2. The Body<br />
3. The Conclusion.</p>
<h5>THE INTRODUCTION</h5>
<h5>It says (ATTENTION EVERYONE – Can I have your attention?)</h5>
<p>Words used at this stage consists of both the (capture word/ phrase and question Phrase).</p>
<p>For me, I like to call it the imagining stage, a stage where you get into your reader&#8217;s mind and create a mental picture with an emotional experience.</p>
<p>It means &#8211; Using attention-grabbing questions and phrases like;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever wondered?</li>
<li>Have you ever found yourself?</li>
<li>Are you a content writer looking to improve your writing skills?</li>
<li>Have you noticed?</li>
<li>Do you want to know how?</li>
<li>Do you hate?</li>
<li>Can you imagine?</li>
<li>Do you know?</li>
<li>You can also start with these;</li>
<li>Check this out! Good news, Listen, Look, Hey! The fact has shown that.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the IMAGINING STAGE, Phrases like (Picture this, imagine, I know the feeling, I can imagine, I know what you are thinking, I have been there too), are used to connect emotionally with the reader.</p>
<p>Once you have gotten their attention and created a mental image that connects with their emotions, you transit to the Body.</p>
<h5>THE BODY &#8211; WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?</h5>
<p>Yes, you now have my attention. What do you have to say?</p>
<p>At this stage, two things happen- THEY STAY OR THEY LEAVE.<br />
If you want the first, Get down to business, answer your question, ask more questions, make sure to keep them hooked. (The relevance of our content matters a lot here)</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Phrases like</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s get started,</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s jump in!</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s dig a little deeper.</li>
<li>Let me show you how</li>
<li>Let me explain</li>
<li>First, let&#8217;s</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s go</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s dive in</li>
<li>Here is how it works</li>
<li>Do you want to know how it works?</li>
</ul>
<p>Conjuncts like; besides, moreover, to begin with, that&#8217;s not all, in other cases, most of all, or even better, for instance, nevertheless, works magic.</p>
<p>Using disjunct like; honestly, obviously, clearly, quite simply, make no mistake about it, believe it or not, usually, believe it or not, personally, can add conversational value to your content.</p>
<p>Pausing for a moment will keep your reader in suspense. At this point, you could ask another question.</p>
<p>Now stop right there! Think for a moment, think about it like this, how is that, why? Consider this&#8230;</p>
<p>To add supporting information, make use of phrases like: Before we go any further, But first let&#8217;s, Before we go into that, back to what I was saying, Look at these examples, let&#8217;s see how this works, here are the details, ask yourself these details.</p>
<p>To share your points and offer solutions, use lines like:- the point here is, Here&#8217;s the big thing, my point is, want to know the best part? Here&#8217;s the clue, The key to, this great secret/tip/technique, Here is how you go about this, the answer is.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to make it look simple- people have a lot on their minds already. Use words like; Sounds easy enough yeah? It is simple, this is so simple,</p>
<p>Let’s move to the final part &#8211; The Conclusion.</p>
<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
<p>Congratulations! You have been able to retain them, so what now? We move!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s conclude what we started, so at this stage, you want to give them a parting gift or let&#8217;s call it a Final impression which will determine if you will get a standing ovation. So, you will need to wind up with a lasting impression.</p>
<p>Please note that more than the body, your Introduction, and your endings must be HIGHLY IMPRESSIVE because they have a significant impact on your reader.</p>
<p>What you will be doing here is simple &#8211; SUMMARIZE, LEAVE THEM THINKING, CALL TO ACTION.</p>
<p>Here are some phrases for a perfect finish:</p>
<p>TO SUMMARIZE, use (To sum up, to conclude, Let&#8217;s have a recap, In a nutshell, In essence)</p>
<p>TO LEAVE THEM THINKING, use (It is up to you, what are you waiting for, Do you want it? Don&#8217;t take my word for it, this choice is yours, it is your call, this is the point where you decide, don’t miss out on this, over to you, it is worth it?)</p>
<p>FOR CALL TO ACTION, use (give it a try, I&#8217;d like to know your thought, comment below, what do you think, share if this was helpful)</p>
<p>You may still be wondering why you should use a bucket brigade technique?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>1. It keeps your reader focused on your content, and this will increase the time your audience spends on your website (High Dwell-time). Do you know what this means? It means you get organic traffic and a low bounce rate.</p>
<p>Like I explained above, two things happen when someone lands on your website from a search engine. It is either “THEY EITHER STAY OR LEAVE”.</p>
<p>When Google notices that people spend time on your site, they believe it has something good and will give it a rank boosting.</p>
<p>When people leave (High bounce rate.) Google drops you down like trash!</p>
<p>2. It helps you connect emotionally with your audience.</p>
<p>3. If your readers enjoyed it and can connect with your content, they will come back and/or will refer someone. Do you know what this means? You get an above-average click-through rate and Lots of social shares and comments.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting, yeah?</p>
<p>Well, there are a lot more connector words available out there, so be on the lookout for more of these phrases in articles, papers, blog and emails.</p>
<p>Now that you understand what bucket brigades are and how they work, you should succeed when applying them.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that using grease-slide phrases will have no impact on IRRELEVANT CONTENT. Yes! Your content is essential.</p>
<p>And by the way, do you know that you can create your bucket brigade?</p>
<p>Now you know, Over to you!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content is the lifeblood of digital marketing and developing a content marketing style guide is the first step that brand custodians should take on the content marketing ladder.</p>
<h5>HERE&#8217;S WHY</h5>
<p>The perception that people have of your brand is mostly formed from what a brand says and how they say it amongst other things. When a particular tone and style of writing is maintained consistently, it helps a brand to build trust and a style that will become synonymous with the brand. Moreso, it will help a brand attract the right target audience.</p>
<p>As a high net-worth brand, you don&#8217;t want to attract the wrong people with poor design, tone, and language.</p>
<p>In some cases, a brand&#8217;s style of writing and tone can help uncover impersonation or fraud perpetrated against the brand.</p>
<p>For example, poor/inconsistent formatting and typographical errors have become one of the ways of distinguishing a bank&#8217;s mail to its customers from fraudulent and phishing emails.</p>
<p>While this attention to detail may seem small and unimportant,  things like this add up and if you are consistent throughout every content format you publish, then it helps people form an impression of your brand.</p>
<h5>THE CHALLENGE</h5>
<p>Now that you understand the need to develop a content marketing style guide for your brand, the challenge with putting it into practice may be that you are quite unsure of how to write one or perhaps,  you may not know the elements that such document should contain. If this is you, here are some tips to get you started on developing a content marketing style guide for your brand</p>
<h5>Elements of a Content Marketing Style Guide</h5>
<h5>1. Define your writing goals and principles</h5>
<p>It is not just enough to write beautiful pieces of content but you must know why you write and for whom you write. Knowing this will ensure that your content meets its objectives and delivers a return on investment.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what your writing goal should look like:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Empower. Help CEO&#8217;s of medium-sized companies understand taxation by using language that informs them and advises them on how to go about their company&#8217;s tax documentation and filing.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is just one example, you can actually have as much as you can in relation to your company&#8217;s business goals.</p>
<p>Your content can engage, educate, inform, enable, entertain, delight, sell, amplify etc</p>
<h5>2. Define your brand&#8217;s tone and voice</h5>
<p>To do this, you have to look inwards at your brand and what you stand for. To help you define your brand voice, think of your brand as a person. Then ask the following question;</p>
<p>a. If your brand were a person, who would it be? (parent, teacher, student, friend, teenager, celebrity etc.)</p>
<p>b. If your brand were a person, how would it make your target audience feel? (upbeat, safe, happy, cautious, carefree etc.)</p>
<p>c. If your brand were a person, what kind of personality would it have? (friendly, playful, authoritative, warm, inspiring, professional)</p>
<p>d. What tone of voice would it use to speak to your audience? (personal, humble, clinical, honest, direct, scientific)</p>
<p>e. What language would you use to pass your message? (complex, savvy, insider, serious, simple, jargon-filled, fun, whimsical)</p>
<p>For example, if you’re a fashion designer, your brand voice could be something like this;</p>
<p>Elite but affordable</p>
<p>Savvy</p>
<p>Professional yet Warm etc</p>
<p>After identifying the words that best explain what your brand is about, create content that matches that voice and personality.</p>
<h5>3. Define the grammar and mechanics</h5>
<p>You need to define the grammar that the brand will employ. For example:</p>
<p>Will it be American English or British English?</p>
<p>How will you write abbreviations and capital letters?</p>
<p>Will &#8220;Ebook&#8221; be written as &#8220;E-book&#8221;, &#8220;e-book&#8221;. ebook&#8221; or &#8220;Ebook&#8221;? etc</p>
<h5>4. Content for specific platforms</h5>
<p>You need to list out the types of content that should be shared on specific platforms. Here is an example of Twitter Platform content below:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Twitter: Service news, brand promotion, events, media mentions, evergreen content, “we’re hiring!” posts, industry news, quotes</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>It is important to state this clearly as some types of content do not go well with certain platforms.</p>
<h5>5. Visual Style</h5>
<p>This details the visual style of the brand. For example, where will the logo be placed on visual content?  What font type will be used?, What colours? what kind of images?  etc.</p>
<p>Usually, if the brand has an existing Brand Identity Manual, this section can simply be updated with the defined style in the Brand Identity manual. If not, then this needs to be developed fully.</p>
<p>Now that you know the elements that a  content marketing style guide should content, it is best to get started and create one for your brand.</p>
