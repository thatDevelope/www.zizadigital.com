										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many professional services firms do not have a marketing department or team. Quite a few don&#8217;t even have a single dedicated individual who focuses on promoting their company.</p>
<p>Often, sales and marketing fall to the owner, director, CEO, COO, or a high-level company leader. They already have their hands full, and building a successful lead-generation strategy quickly becomes an afterthought.</p>
<p>While you need tactics that generate revenue now — you also know that focusing solely on the “here and now” will leave you constantly chasing the next lead.</p>
<p>Organisations that are looking to grow need to strategize their lead-generation into something repeatable and reliable in order to have business stability and predictable growth.</p>
<p>That’s where podcasts come in.</p>
<p>With the right approach, you can use your podcast episodes to connect with potential customers and build a relationship long before they even signify interest in your services. Podcasting gives you short-term returns while building content and relationships for long-term growth.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the details of how to use podcasts to connect with leads and see how you can reap the benefits for your organisation. Before we do that, let&#8217;s even understand what Podcasting is.</p>
<h5>What Is Podcasting?</h5>
<p>A podcast is a series of audio content episodes, focused on a particular theme. In a world where everyone is constantly on the move and people crave more information, podcasting has become a great way to share content and an important piece of the marketing pie.</p>
<p>The purpose of Podcasting is to create conversations that help to solve the pain points or challenges that your ideal prospects and/or clients face. These conversations can feature different guests and thought leaders who have expertise in the subject area. Some of these guests can even be Clients or prospects and it may lead to sales opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Podcasting opens a door for you to create genuine relationships with industry experts, thought leaders, and your ideal clients. Asking prospects and clients to be your podcast guest allows you to break the ice and get one-on-one time with your target customers while also sharing real insights from people who have real experiences on the topic of discussion. For example, I was recently featured as a guest on the <a href="https://pichastock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picha</a> Podcast where i shared insights on Influencer Marketing. You can <a href="https://pichastock.com/blog/2020/10/21/talking-influencer-marketing-with-agbons-igiewe-pichapodcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listen on Picha blog</a> or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-883298473/pichapodcast-episode-4-talking-influencer-marketing-with-agbons-igiewe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listen on Soundcloud</a></p>
<h5><strong>What is Account-Based Podcasting?</strong></h5>
<p>Account-based podcasting is a podcasting strategy that concentrates resources on a set of target accounts within a market and seeks to help solve the subject challenge for that market.</p>
<h5><strong>3 Benefits of Account Based Podcasting</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Benefit #1: One-on-One Time With Your Ideal Customers</strong></h5>
<p>If you’ve ever done any prospecting like cold calling or cold emailing, you know how quickly people will give you the cold shoulder. It&#8217;s rare to come across someone who will respond positively to your message.</p>
<p>No one likes to receive some random sales pitch from someone they don’t know, so you&#8217;ll be ignored or worse. These days, if they choose to take offence, they can easily <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/authorspeakeradvisor_if-you-folks-keep-spamming-me-on-linkedin-activity-6722183704665559040--Gbt" target="_self" rel="noopener">call you out</a> on social media.</p>
<p>With account-based podcasting, you can make cold emailing work for you in a way that you couldn’t before. Instead of a sales pitch, you’re offering to promote them on your show for free.</p>
<p>Most people are flattered when asked for an interview. Because of that, it&#8217;s relatively easy to get people to be a guest on your podcast.</p>
<p>Use a template like the one below when you do your outreach, and you’ll likely have your first few guests lined up in no time. I’ve included a template shared by Bernie Borges at the last <a href="https://www.inbound.com/2020-speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot Inbound 2020 Conference</a>.</p>
<h5><strong>Sample Outreach Template</strong></h5>
<div class="bd_img">
<img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="825" height="370" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-377" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads.png 825w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-300x135.png 300w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" />
</div>
<h5><strong>Template in Action</strong></h5>
<div class="bd_img">
<img decoding="async" width="859" height="411" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-378" src="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-1.png 859w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-1-300x144.png 300w, https://www.zizadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Professional-Services-Firms-Can-Use-Podcasts-To-Connect-With-Leads-1-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" />
</div>
<p>Using this strategy gets you talking with your ideal customers fast, and it enables you to build relationships with them naturally. You stand a much better chance of converting them into paying clients in the future should the need arise for them to use your services.</p>
<h5><strong>Benefit #2: Each Episode Creates Several Types of Content</strong></h5>
<p>When recording your podcast episodes, don’t make the mistake of recording just the audio. Record your interviews using video so that you can get the benefit of creating multiple types of content simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can upload the video to your YouTube channel and publish it on your website with a blog. You’ll also get the benefit of turning your video into an audio-only file so you can share it on all the podcasting channels.</p>
<p>If you use a program like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maz0TVyTwiw" target="_self" rel="noopener">Descript</a>, you can generate a transcript of the video for use on your blog or podcast show notes. Descript even lets you clean up your &#8220;ums&#8221; and &#8220;uhs,&#8221; and fix mistakes without re-recording the episode.</p>
<p>Producing and publishing all this content allows you to generate backlinks and increase your website&#8217;s search engine ranking. In the meantime, with your podcast, you&#8217;re building authority in your industry, creating brand awareness, and opening doors to potential clients.</p>
<h5><strong>Benefit #3: It Establishes You as a Thought Leader</strong></h5>
<p>Have you ever noticed that when you hang around experts, other people assume you’re an expert too? If not, you’ll definitely start to notice it when you launch your new podcast show.</p>
<p>Not only will people assume you’re an expert, but over time, you’ll become one. The longer you do the show and the more people you interview, the more you’ll learn about your ideal customers.</p>
<p>You’ll come to understand them and their industry on a whole new level because you’ll continuously hear insiders’ perspectives from your guests.</p>
<p>As a bonus, you’ll clarify your messaging and improve your services with the more you learn about your customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Marketing</h5>
<p>Your professional services firm is most on the path to failure or indefinite struggle without a marketing strategy. Nevertheless, the presence of one does not guarantee success. There are a number of actions prone to endangering your brand perception, as well as negatively impacting your ROI.</p>
<p>In working with several professional services firms across Nigeria, we have identified 5 marketing mistakes that are common with these firms. Read on to learn these five mistakes and how to avoid them in your own organisation.</p>
<h5>1. Not having a dedicated marketing team:</h5>
<p>Professional Services firms often run marketing as an extension of the MD&#8217;s desk. This means that there is no dedicated marketing staff or team to do mind the task. In its stead is an MD who implements marketing tactics at his convenience and mostly in piece meals as he neither has the time nor the expertise to implement strategic marketing communications for the firm.</p>
<p>One implication of this is that the value gained from marketing in this kind of firm will be next to nothing and as time goes on, the MD might be inclined to think that marketing doesn&#8217;t achieve results. The budget invested in marketing in a firm like this will be wasted.</p>
<p>Another consequence is that if the firm has a strong competition that is focused on consistent marketing with a desk of dedicated and strong marketing professionals, it will only be a matter of time before the competitor overtakes the firm.</p>
<h5>2. Long approval process:</h5>
<p>This is especially true for firms that do not have a dedicated marketing team. The aftermath of which being the approval process for marketing projects will be tedious and hard as there is no one consciously looking out for these projects. Besides, professional services firms are conservative in nature and have long approval processes.</p>
<p>Marketing, on the other hand, moves at the speed of light and long approval processes may hinder marketing campaigns or projects that are time-sensitive; especially consumer-generated campaigns based on latest industry news or trends, some of which have potency of between one day to one week.</p>
<p>Waiting for the admin to pass it to the GM’s Secretary/PA who then has to weigh the importance and then presents it to the GM when other priorities have given way, which may be two weeks later and no longer relevant at that time.</p>
<h5>3. Treating marketing as an afterthought:</h5>
<p>Most professional service firms do not make allowance for marketing while planning for their firms. It is often treated as an afterthought and receives almost no attention.</p>
<p>This is a mistake that any firm looking to gain relevance and thrive should have no hands in.</p>
<p>Brands often make the mistake of treating marketing only as an afterthought to be looked into when it seems they are way in over their heads and are struggling to keep afloat. Implementing marketing only when the organisation has challenges only puts pressure on marketing to focus on short term goals and tactics like promos, price slash etc.</p>
<h5>4. Not implementing marketing as a long-term project:</h5>
<p>A number of the professional services firms that invest in marketing do so on an ad-hoc basis. They implement a project once in two years and for a short period of time and never consider it again until a distant future. Meanwhile, marketing is supposed to be a huge part of your everyday project in running the organisation.</p>
<p>In one study, it was found that all that is needed to put off a potential client is one moment of dissatisfaction usually from lack of service, speed of return on assignments, lack of insight or experience in a specific sector; all of which is an action inconsistent marketing projects promote.</p>
<p>Like I always say, marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. It is actually never done.</p>
<h5>5. Lack of marketing budget:</h5>
<p>Having things in motion to create content is only the first step. Even more important is the need to strategically have it appear in front of the right audience via hyper-targeted promotions.</p>
<p>For a firm where marketing was not planned for in the first place, there is almost always no budget set aside for it. Without an active budget, nothing gets implemented.</p>
<p>To quote Stuart H. Britt, &#8220;Doing business without advertising is like winking at a girl in the dark. You know what you&#8217;re doing, but nobody else does.&#8221;</p>
<p>You need a marketing budget where your marketing team can periodically dip their hands into to promote your firm’s content to garner the right amount and type of website traffic and leads that will fill your funnel and grow your business.</p>
<p>To correct this mistake, consider including a marketing budget to your firm’s annual budget, to be channeled towards paid advertising like Google Pay-Per-Click (PPC), search engine marketing (SEM) or LinkedIn/other social media sponsored updates are a great way to get your content before the right ‘eyeballs’ as you&#8217;re building your organic audience.</p>
<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
<p>Developing a marketing strategy is vital for the survival and growth of any business. Without one, your efforts to attract and retain customers are likely to be hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>With an effective marketing plan in place, you’ll be able to straighten out such things as who your actual customers are versus who you thought they were, potential new growth opportunities, make viable marketing investments, and avoid these five plus other marketing mistakes that could hurt your firm’s lead generation opportunities and brand reputation.</p>
