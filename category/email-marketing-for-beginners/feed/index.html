<p>Most Business Owners and Brand custodians cringe when they hear Email Marketing. They have been victims of SPAM emails themselves and they simply have no interest in Spamming anyone with their own company mails.</p>
<p>I understand these fears. A lot of Nigerian Marketers abuse the email marketing medium. They buy email addresses from willing vendors and simply spam every Tom, Dick and Harry with their email blast.</p>
<p>However, when professionally and properly used, Email marketing works and still remains one of the most effective digital marketing medium.</p>
<p>The most important role of the email marketing medium is to nurture Prospects into becoming Clients. It is not for you to disturb them and get them to dislike your brand.</p>
<h5>Here are 5 Best Practices for using Email Marketing</h5>
<p>1. Only send emails to people who subscribed, or willingly gave their email addresses in exchange for a download or an offer.  Since they already have prior relationship with you, they are more at ease when they see your mail compared to when they have no relationship with you whatsoever.</p>
<p>It is extremely unprofessional to buy email addresses and then send email blasts. It is like barging into a stranger’s house without prior relationship with the person nor an invitation.</p>
<p>2. Reduce the frequency of emails. Even if someone gives you an invitation to their house by way of subscribing, they don’t expect you to knock on their doors every day. They expect you to show some decorum and allow them their privacy. It is the same thing with email.<br />
You don’t send emails everyday because someone subscribed. Infact, companies who have had great success with email marketing space out the timing of their mails.</p>
<p>3. Your emails should help solve a pain point. Your emails should not focus on selling, selling, selling. It should help solve a pain point for the recipient of the mail. For example, If your company is in the Power Engineering sector, how about sending an email that helps people calculate the number of Watts that they need to run their homes?</p>
<p>4. Your emails should be relevant to the target audience: Do not send an email on 10 Ways to Dispose a diaper to an 80-year-old man. While the information does help to solve a pain point, chances that an 80-year-old man will need this information is very slim.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why you shouldn’t even consider buying email addresses. Because you do not know whose email address you are buying.</p>
<p>5. Your emails should follow a sequence that aligns with your marketing funnel. Don’t just send random emails because the information contained therein is relevant, send emails in line with your marketing funnel so that at the end of the sequence, you are able to guide the recipient to take desired action.</p>
<p>Your email marketing should be drawn out in a strategy with each email working with the next to achieve the overall objective.</p>
<p>Email marketing can generate leads for your firms if you apply it professionally and align it with your marketing funnel.</p>
