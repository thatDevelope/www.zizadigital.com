]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the season where marketing managers and CEOs draw up a digital marketing budget for the upcoming year and the question that usually comes up at a time like this is: what should digital marketing cost?</p>
<p>And what must be included in next year&#8217;s budget?</p>
<p>For many C-suite managers, an exact figure and the risk analysis is all they are waiting for. This exact amount can easily be filled into the blank spaces in the budget template.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not that easy! Because , there isn’t a fixed cost. The cost of digital marketing depends on a lot of variables. For clarity sake, I will outline the platforms, the variables involved and estimate for you a range of costs for each one. That way, you can decide what to budget in line with your marketing objectives and what your organisation can afford.</p>
<h5>What Does Social Media Marketing Cost?</h5>
<p><strong>The average cost for an Agency to manage your Social media pages can range from N250,000 (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira) and above depending on:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>The number of platforms</strong> – Would you like to be on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/ziza_digital" target="_self" rel="noopener">Instagram,</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zizadigital" target="_self" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/zizadigital" target="_self" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pinterest</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.snapchat.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Snapchat</a>, etc.; or only a few of them?</p>
<p>2. <strong>The frequency of posts</strong> – Would you like to have three posts per week or three posts per day?</p>
<p>3. <strong>The kind of posts</strong> – Will the Agency be developing videos, GIFs, or only text and graphics</p>
<p>4. <strong>The Scope of work</strong> &#8211; Will this cover community management?</p>
<p>It must be noted that this does not include media cost that mostly goes to the platform owners for advertising and post sponsorship. Nor does it include the fee for Influencer marketing. Those will have to be treated separately and budgeted for accordingly when the need arises.</p>
<p><strong>The cost of engaging an influencer usually depends on the popularity or brand equity of the influencer and the scope of work required. It can range from N20,000 per post to N300,000 and can go as high as 1 million naira if the Influencer is creating the content.</strong></p>
<p>For Social Media advertising cost, you can budget an average of $0.30 per click for Facebook; $0.50 for Instagram, and $2.50 for LinkedIn. Yes, I can see you rolling your eyes ?, LinkedIn is super expensive.</p>
<p>But the truth is, it gives more quality leads than Facebook, Twitter and Instagram combined. However, it also depends on the industry of the brand that is advertising.</p>
<h5>What Does Email Marketing Cost?</h5>
<p>The basic cost of email marketing is divided into two;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Email Marketing Software cost</strong> – Your email marketing software is the main engine behind email marketing and every business needs a reliable software to run email marketing campaigns. There are several email marketing software solutions but <strong>the average cost can range from $9 and above for 1,000 contacts.</strong> However, as your email contacts increase, so will your software subscription cost.</p>
<p>Also, there will be a consequential increase if you would like to move your email marketing a step further to marketing automation, A/B Testing etc.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Email Content Development Cost</strong> – while the software is the engine that runs email marketing, the content is the lubricant that ensures the engine moves accordingly. Good content will increase your open rate and ultimately your click-through rate. <strong>You can budget an average of N250,000 per month for email marketing content development</strong>. This can get you an average of 4 email campaigns and slightly higher if this includes email sequences which is an important part of marketing automation.</p>
<p><strong>Good content for each email campaign will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The email copy</li>
<li>The title</li>
<li>The Call-to-action</li>
<li>The preview text</li>
</ul>
<h5>What Does Google Advertising Cost?</h5>
<p>Google Advertising is divided into two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Display Network</strong> which shows graphic Ads across several websites</li>
<li><strong>Google Search Network</strong> that shows text ads when someone searches Google for relevant keywords.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>The average cost-per-click (CPC) for Google display network ranges from $0.40 &#8211; $1.20 while the average cost per click (CPC) for Google Search Network is $1 &#8211; $5 depending on the keywords you are bidding for, the industry, the location, and the google optimisation score.</p>
<p>In addition to the media budget, you will need to pay the Agency you are partnering with for the PPC Management. PPC Management is charged at a percentage of the Ad budget.</p>
<p>The fee charged for PPC management can range between 10% to 25% of the Google Advertising budget depending on the relationship between the Client and the Agency and the amount of work required.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may need to also budget for a PPC software that is used for the management of PPC campaigns but this is not compulsory.</p>
<p>On average, small businesses spend around $3,500 (Three thousand, five hundred dollars) a month on Google Ads. This is not cast in stone and can be customised to fit the budget that the client can afford.</p>
<h5>What does Website Development Cost?</h5>
<p><strong>The cost of developing a good website in Nigeria costs between N200,000 and N1,000,000</strong>. The actual cost of the website will depend on the following variables:</p>
<p>1. Will the website be developed from scratch or is the developer using a template?</p>
<p>2. Will it be an E-commerce website or an informational website?</p>
<p>3. How many pages will the website have?</p>
<p>4. Will SEO be implemented on the website?</p>
<p>While some people generally advertise that they can build a website for <strong>N</strong>20,000 (Twenty Thousand Naira), the quality of that kind of website can certainly not be compared to professional websites.</p>
<p>Do note that the cost of developing a website does not include the cost of buying the domain name, the hosting, and SSL. Your domain name is your organisation’s address on the web while the Hosting is the container that holds the domain files. This is where the website will be seated.</p>
<p>All organisations need a domain name to have a website. Your domain name is <a href="http://www.yourcompanyname.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">www.yourcompanyname.com</a>. Both the domain name and hosting are usually provided by a hosting provider like <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hostgator.com</a>, <a href="http://godaddy.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godaddy.com</a>, <a href="http://www.whogohost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whogohost.com</a> etc.</p>
<p><strong>The average cost of a domain name can range from $9 to $15</strong> depending on the kind of domain name. In some cases where the domain has been parked (bought by someone else who is willing to resell), the domain name can sell for as high as $50,000 (Fifty thousand dollars) – Yes, this isn’t a mistake – Fifty Thousand Dollars?!</p>
<p>Some domains are also classified as premium and command a higher fee than the average domain cost.</p>
<p>While the cost of building a website is a one-off cost, you will need to renew your domain and your hosting annually. This fee will need to be paid to your hosting provider.</p>
<p>In some cases where the business does not have a dedicated Brand/Marketing Manager or Writer, you may need to pay for Website Content Development as your website needs good content to communicate your brand equity and generate leads for you. This cost can be included in the website development cost if discussed at the inception of the project.</p>
<p>Once the website has been completed and handed over to the organisation, there is a need for the organisation to retain the services of a website Administrator to manage the website continuously. This person will be responsible for updating plugins, updating content, publishing posts, etc. This person needs not be a staff, he/she can be a freelancer or an Agency that manages websites.</p>
<p>The website developer can also be retained as the Website administrator but will need to be put on a monthly retainer for this as the cost of building a website does not include continuous website management.</p>
<h4>What Does Search Engine Optimisation Cost?</h4>
<p>This is perhaps the most straightforward one<strong>. The average cost of optimising 10 keywords is between N100,000 and N300,000</strong>. This includes both the on-page and off-page SEO which covers listing, meta tags, PDF submission, Social bookmarking, article promotion, etc. As the number of keywords increases, so does the cost.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that organic SEO is a long-term project and requires between 4-6months of constant work to rank selected keywords. This doesn&#8217;t mean that work stops after 6 months, organic optimisation requires consistent work to reach the first page and stay there.</p>
<p>Now that you have been introduced to the various elements of digital marketing and their cost as stand-alone platforms; the next question is whether you have the personnel in-house to achieve the goal&#8230;and you may then wonder what the cost of getting an Agency on retainer to provide integrated digital marketing services covering all platforms relevant for your brand will be?</p>
<h4>What Does Integrated Digital Marketing Cost?</h4>
<p>Individual digital platforms are great to reach your target audience but to get tangible value out of digital marketing, you need to focus on integrated digital marketing which uses the integrated approach to generate awareness, engage with your prospects, generate leads, and build brand equity.</p>
<p>For example, you want to incorporate Blogging, Social media, Google Ads, Email Marketing, Marketing Automation, Search Engine Optimisation, etc. for your brand.</p>
<p>In this case, you will need an Agency that will dedicate a team with experience in the different areas of digital marketing to manage your brand. Businesses sometimes make the mistake of hiring one person to perform all digital marketing roles &#8211; Content development, design, website management, PPC Management, SEO, etc. <a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/setting-up-your-digital-marketing-team" target="_self" rel="noopener">Check out our blog post on building a digital marketing team here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The average cost for full strategic digital marketing monthly retainership ranges from N800,000 &#8211; N5 million</strong> depending on the scope of work and the number of personnel required to implement it.</p>
<p>In addition to the Agency retainership fee which is paid monthly, you will need to set aside a media budget for third-party platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Yahoo Ads, etc.</p>
<p>You will also need to set aside a budget for marketing software as these are the tools required to implement your <a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/how-to-create-a-digital-marketing-strategy" target="_self" rel="noopener">digital marketing strategy</a>. While there are different software for the different aspects of digital marketing, there are also several full-stack marketing software that covers all areas of marketing and one subscription will take care of your email marketing, Landing page, Chatbots, SEO, PPC, etc. An example of this is <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">HubSpot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The average full-stack marketing software costs between $250 to $5000 depending on the platform, the number of contacts, the number of users, the capability of the platform, etc.</strong></p>
<h4>The Advantages of Digital Marketing</h4>
<p><strong>Budget Flexibility</strong> &#8211; While the costs for the various platforms have been listed, it is important to note that you can decide how much to spend on digital marketing as the budget is very flexible. You can program your Facebook Ads to run for $50 and once the budget is exhausted, the Ad stops.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Time Analytics</strong> &#8211; You can also get real-time analytics which tells you which platform is doing great and which one needs to be fine-tuned or stopped altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Not Dependent on Company Size &#8211; </strong>Implementing Digital Marketing is a fantastic marketing decision irrespective of the business size and industry as it has varied platforms and tactics. A one-man organisation can implement digital marketing just like a 500-man organisation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New to email marketing and are wondering where to begin? Here are 6 email marketing techniques to get you started</p>
<p>Let’s define the term, and examine the reason why email marketing is still relevant in today’s digital marketing scene, then we’ll end with the best techniques to use for a beginner to get a great ROI.</p>
<h5><strong>What is Email Marketing?</strong></h5>
<p>We don’t like to take things for granted, so let’s begin by defining Email Marketing so we’re on the same page.</p>
<p>Email marketing is the use of electronic mail to promote and give updates about your goods and services to prospects and existing customers.</p>
<p>To do that, you need contacts or recipients to send emails to; a database of people interested in your product or service and have shown this interest by responding to the call-to-action on your website asking them to sign up to receive updates and news from you.</p>
<h5><strong>Why is Email Still Relevant in Today’s Digital Marketing Scene?</strong></h5>
<p>Email is one of the most effective marketing components of digital marketing, but also one of the most abused and I dare say underused.</p>
<p>In this age where your senses are constantly assaulted everywhere you turn with all kinds of advertising, the inbox was meant to be a safe zone and act as a sanctuary of sorts from all that. A place you may enter, but can’t stay without permission from the owner and without being relevant or adding value to them.</p>
<p>But now, with spammers abusing this medium of marketing, it’s harder than ever to reach people effectively this way because they’re afraid of receiving constant worthless bulk messages from marketers concerning products or services they’re not even interested in to begin with.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that it feels like an invasion of privacy, it’s also very annoying, to say the least.</p>
<p>Despite this challenge, smart marketers have figured out a way to get people to look forward to receiving mail from them consistently. And in the long run, turn recipients into loyal repeat customers.</p>
<p>Also thankfully, email service providers have come up with a way to block spam messages from getting to users, which in turn has forced marketers to be creative with this form of marketing.</p>
<h5><strong>6 Email Marketing Techniques for Beginners</strong></h5>
<p>What’s the secret of those who get the job done? Well, I’ll be sharing with you 6 proven effective email marketing techniques that we at ZIZA Digital use to drive some of the businesses that we manage</p>
<h5>1. The perfect email subject line:</h5>
<p>As with all advertising, the number one aim is to grab attention and keep it long enough to be heard.</p>
<p>Only after being heard can prospects develop interest and become leads, then leads become customers.</p>
<p>So if you’re offering content, or have a great deal or new update you don’t want a prospect or client to miss out on, the key to getting them interested at first glance is to have a catchy subject title.</p>
<p>Depending on your niche and industry, creativity is really needed here. Examples of great subject lines;</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions for saving money during NYSC or</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suggestions for saving money this festive season <em>(if you’re in the banking or financial industry)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sales: 50% off everything (if you have products available for sale)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Laptops for as low as 20,000 Naira, limited offer only.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the title will get the receiver curious enough to open it.</p>
<h5>2. The Perfect Timing</h5>
<p>It is important to send your emails at the perfect time so that they can get read before they are pushed down by other emails. While having the perfect subject line is good, sending at the perfect time improves the chances of your mail being read by 50%.</p>
<p>For example, busy professionals only have a few hours a day to come online, so the best time to reach such people may be between 8 p.m and midnight after they’re done with work and want to relax and catch up before going to bed.</p>
<p>So study your target audience and their typical behaviour pattern so you can know when best to reach them.</p>
<p>Also sending reminder emails at the nick of time is effective when turning existing customers to repeat customers.</p>
<p>For example, sending a reminder to renew subscription days or a week before expiration helps the customer plan accordingly and make a decision beforehand instead of just cutting them off the service without warning or sending a reminder a day before doing so.</p>
<p>Sending emails during the weekend is also quite as effective as the 8 pm to 12 a.m trick for a select target audience.</p>
<h5>3. Give free content (valuable information) through email</h5>
<p>Who doesn’t love free quality things? It is the ultimate bait and it is very effective when you want to get people to do something they normally would hesitate to do, like try out a new product with no precedence.</p>
<p>When you consistently give away free quality content, templates or tools, you build trust between you and your prospects, and when they trust you, they’re open to whatever you want to sell later on. This doesn&#8217;t mean they’ll automatically purchase things from you but they just will be more willing to listen and consider your goods and services especially if they need it.</p>
<p>This isn’t limited to content alone, giving out demos, trial versions, products, and services or coupons with huge discounts will always draw people in, and if what they use is good, could turn them into customers quicker than talking yourself out trying to convince them your product or service is worth a try.</p>
<h5>4. Ask for permission to send them emails</h5>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin, permission marketing</a> will be linked to email marketing permanently.</p>
<p>The concept implies that business owners and brands first seek permission from visitors of their websites before sending them emails. Once you get this permission, you can then personalize the content of the email and do follow-ups accordingly.</p>
<p>You seek permission by asking them to subscribe to newsletters or updates on your website via the call to action buttons. Getting permission to inbox them instead of obtaining their email details in other ways is very important because it’s like getting permission to come to their house to have lunch with them. Do not abuse the privilege by spamming and sending junk messages.</p>
<h5>5. Personalization</h5>
<p>Admit it, when you receive an email with your first name on it, don’t you feel like it’s personal? Hence, you read it till the end because you feel it’s specially written to you.</p>
<p>In the same vein, for your email campaigns to be effective, pay attention to the specifics. Make sure the content is tailored to each recipient’s SPECIFIC needs and peculiarities. You can send bulk mail but add a personal touch to it so it feels like a real person sent it not a bot.</p>
<p>Pay attention to each detail so you don&#8217;t send the right message to the wrong audience, therefore coming off as spammy.</p>
<h5>6. Analytics. Track and measure your email marketing campaigns</h5>
<p>Analytics is simply keeping track of the campaign process. From tracking to know how many people actually received your email, to how many people opened and saw your email, how many people actually responded to it by clicking a call to action or contact link embedded in the email, how many people visited your site as a direct result of reading your mail etc.</p>
<p>All this information will help you see what’s working for you, what isn’t, what needs to improve or be changed, and how effective your campaigns are. This knowledge will help you fine tune your methods and get better which will yield better ROI in the long run. And a higher return on investment is every marketer’s dream.</p>
<p>Email marketing can be fun, easy and a cost-effective way to boost sales, connect with your target audience and build your brand.  Here&#8217;s hoping the above techniques will help you use this marketing tactic more effectively.</p>
