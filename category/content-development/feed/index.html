]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve gotten over 900 more followers and 5000 more likes on your social media page in the last month, great! But calculating your marketing success rate shouldn’t have to end there. Infact, most times, these feel-good numbers are purely vanity metrics and don’t directly convert to sales or engagement.</p>
<p>As business owners, we tend to forget that actionable marketing metrics are what is most important in measuring the success of our overall digital marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Marketing metrics are key indicators that show how well a business’ digital marketing campaign has performed. It also gives you a better understanding of how visitors react to your business and helps you evaluate and <a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/how-to-create-a-digital-marketing-strategy">improve on your digital marketing strategy</a></p>
<p>However, these metrics are measured in relation to a business goal as well as the marketing channels used.. For example, for a business whose goal is brand awareness, reach and unique visits to the website should be an important metric that it should measure</p>
<p>The question is, what metrics should you measure in relation to a business or marketing goal? Here are 10 Marketing Metrics you should measure.</p>
<h5>Marketing metrics to measure</h5>
<h5>1.  WEBSITE TRAFFIC SOURCE</h5>
<p>Every business should have a web presence, Your website is your company profile on the web. It is  one of the first places that visitors interact with your brand especially to get more information on the kind of services you offer, therefore it is key to track the sources where your website visitors come from.</p>
<p>Tracking a traffic source helps you to channel more marketing efforts to the high performing sources from which they came as well as choose to improve your search engine optimization strategy or <a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/signs-your-social-media-marketing-is-faulty">social media marketing strategy</a> depending on which channel has a low performance rate.</p>
<h5>2.  NEW VISITORS AND RETURNING VISITORS</h5>
<p>Understanding your visitor behaviour helps you figure out the pattern your visitors go through, what content interests them, how they engage with different pages on your website, how long their session duration lasts and eventually convert to sales.</p>
<p>New visitors are good but returning visitors are better. This means that it is highly important to track the rate at which visitors come back to your website, because the higher the return rate, the higher the likelihood of conversion. If you find that your website’s returning visitors rate is low, then it&#8217;s time for you to adjust your inbound marketing strategy accordingly. Some areas you can Improve  include: search engine optimisation, search engine marketing, social media marketing, <a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/5-best-practices-for-winning-with-email-marketing">email marketing</a> etc. with the aim of  creating a valuable experience for the visitor.</p>
<h5>3.  LEAD TO QUALIFIED LEADS RATIO</h5>
<p>Not all leads are marketing qualified leads. A Marketing Qualified Lead is a prospective client who has shown more interest in your services than your average lead, and is now ready to be nurtured and passed down the marketing funnel as a Sales Qualified Lead, which eventually leads to a conversion.</p>
<p>Monitoring a lead to qualified leads ratio helps you evaluate the quality of leads your CRM passes down to your sales team as well as adjust the criteria for <a href="https://blog.zizadigital.com/lead-generation-tips-for-professional-services-firms">business qualified leads</a>.</p>
<h5>4. REACH</h5>
<p>Depending on your digital marketing goals, tracking metrics like reach, can show you unique visitors that visit your website or your social media pages. This metric is best measured for businesses whose goal is to get brand awareness.</p>
<h5>5.  BOUNCE RATE</h5>
<p>A bounce rate is the average number of visitors that left your website after visiting only one page. A bounce rate can be both a good and a bad sign for your website. On the negative side, a bounce rate can tell you how relevant that page is to the keywords optimised for it. On the flip side, it can also show that the visitor came on the page, found what they were searching for and left. These two scenarios can be differentiated by the number of sessions the visitor stayed on that page, with the latter having a high chance of a return visitor.</p>
<p>Also having a difficult UI (User interface) or UX (User experience) on your website can lead to a high bounce rate. In that case it&#8217;s best to improve on your website development and design.</p>
<h5>6.  CONVERSION RATE</h5>
<p>This is the most important metric to determine whether or not your marketing efforts were useful in reaching your marketing goals. Basically, the ratio of a website&#8217;s visitor to conversion. Conversions vary from business to business. It can be a sale for an eCommerce store,  a newsletter signup or  an eBook download for a service brand.</p>
<p>A conversion rate is calculated by the  total number of  visitors divided by the total number of conversions multiplied by 100</p>
<h5>7.  CLICK-THROUGH RATE</h5>
<p>A CTR measures the number of link clicks in an advertisement or an email. It is good for measuring how successful your ad campaigns or email campaigns are performing. A lot of factors determine how often your ad links are clicked, which includes, call to action copy, keywords used, images, positioning of the ads etc. Click-Through Rates are calculated by the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions.</p>
<h5>8.  COST PER CLICK</h5>
<p>This is the amount of money you pay to Google (or any other Ad platform) for each click on your pay-per-click digital marketing ad campaigns. A good cost per click should always be low as it is determined by several factors like the quality score of your website or landing page, keyword bidding, Google ad rank. CPC is calculated by the total spend divided by the total number of clicks.</p>
<h5>9. RETURN ON INVESTMENT</h5>
<p>This is the overall measurement on how your marketing investments are contributing to the success of your digital marketing campaign. Knowing your ROI helps to evaluate whether the digital marketing spend is worth the revenue. ROI data can help you improve performance on less successful digital marketing campaigns as well as help you decide on a digital marketing budget. ROI is calculated by dividing Net profit by cost of investment multiplied by 100.</p>
<h5>In Conclusion&#8230;</h5>
<p>Digital marketing analytics tools like Google analytics and <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a> analytics as well as social media marketing tools like <a href="http://www.hootsuitecom/">Hootsuite</a>, <a href="http://www.buzzsumo.com/">Buzzsumo</a>, etc are some of the tools that your business can use to measure its digital marketing campaign metrics to know if you are on the right track or if you need to revisit your digital marketing campaign strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-target-iframe" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PGMExBC1zrk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-service="youtube"></iframe></p>
<h5>HOW TO SET-UP A TOP-NOTCH DIGITAL MARKETING TEAM FOR YOUR ORGANISATION (VIDEO)</h5>
<p>Congratulations! You have recently been hired to lead a business or you are already an MD/CEO/COO of a company and you understand the importance of digital marketing for business growth.</p>
<p>Of course, you need the required personnel to run your digital marketing projects so you ask HR to employ.</p>
<p>Then HR rolls out the job specification below:</p>
<h5>Digital Marketing Executive Job Specification</h5>
<p><strong><em>The successful candidate must be a master of Email Marketing, E-commerce, Social Media Marketing, Content Marketing, Lead generation, Affiliate Marketing, White label &amp; Drop shipping, Landing pages, Copy Writing, Facebook &amp; Google AD, Content creation, Marketing &amp; Online PR, Graphics design, Audience Research &amp; Targeting, A/B Split-Testing, SEO/Copy writing, Technical Writing, Website content, keyword Analysis &amp; Research, Video Marketing, Community management, Sales funnels, Marketing Spend Optimization.</em></strong></p>
<p>Infact, this is an actual Job specification that was shared on LinkedIn by a HR personnel who was recruiting for a firm ?.</p>
<p>With a job specification like this, there is absolutely no way the employee will deliver marketing results!</p>
<p>Digital Marketing requires different skill sets and requires a team of people who have those skills.</p>
<h5>Your Digital Marketing Team Should Consist Of (At Least):</h5>
<ul>
<li>A Digital Graphic Artist</li>
<li>A Content Writer (Having a knowledge of SEO is an added advantage)</li>
<li>A Strategist</li>
<li>A Programmer/Web Developer</li>
</ul>
<p>For low traffic brands, the strategist can also double as the Social Media Manager and can also manage email marketing campaigns, PPC and Marketing automation.</p>
<p>For high traffic brands like e-commerce, there is need to have a different person for other roles like Social Media Manager, PPC Manager, Marketing Automation, Search Engine Optimisation and so on</p>
<h5><strong>If you are looking to get value out of digital marketing, you need a team with the right expertise to get it done.</strong></h5>
<p>You cannot hire one person to write content, design it, share it, respond to comments, schedule marketing automation, edit/build websites, set up PPC campaigns, build landing pages etc.</p>
<p>All of these  require a different set of skills.</p>
<p>It is like hiring one doctor as a Dentist, a Surgeon, A Pediatrician, A dermatologist, An Ophthalmologist, an oncologist and so on.</p>
<p>What outcome do you expect to get from this doctor?</p>
<p>While some businesses may not be able to hire all these persons in house because of the resultant cost, there are two ways you can actually hire a full digital marketing team without breaking the bank.</p>
<h5>TWO WAYS TO HIRE A FULL DIGITAL MARKETING TEAM WITHOUT BREAKING THE BANK</h5>
<h5><strong>Option 1 &#8211; Work With A Digital Marketing Agency</strong></h5>
<p>Hire a Brand Manager who sits in house and works with a Digital Marketing Agency to get things done. Your Brand Manager can serve as your strategist, He/she will develop strategies and briefs in collaboration with the Agency Strategist. Once approved by the management team, the Agency executes the brief with its team of Content Writers, Artists, Programmers, PPC Specialists, Community Managers etc.</p>
<h5><strong>What Are The Advantages of Working With An Agency Team?</strong></h5>
<p>1. <strong>It is cost effective</strong>. You get the full marketing team working on your brand but only get to pay a part of their salaries since the Agency team is a shared team.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Less Errors</strong>. Your brand gets to benefit from several Agency checks and balances put in place to reduce error margins.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2 &#8211; Work With Freelancers</strong></p>
<p>You hire a brand manager who works with a team of freelancers with the needed skills to get the job done.</p>
<p>One challenge you may experience with this option is the lack of ownership and accountability from freelancers as they usually have a project mindset and are not concerned with the long term benefits of the brand.</p>
<p><strong>Taking A Decision</strong></p>
<p>Whichever option you chose to go with largely depends on your brand and what you are looking to achieve with marketing.</p>
<p>Hiring one person to manage the full digital marketing for your firm amounts to hiring an octopus, and nine times out of ten, it is guaranteed to fail.</p>
<p><strong>Looking to x-ray your business to see which option is a good fit?</strong></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are over 92 million connected devices in Nigeria <em>(Source NCC)</em>. If you subtract those with multiple phones and possibly other devices like ATMs, we can safely say we have about 70million people who are connected in Nigeria.</p>
<p>All these people are on the internet for at least one of these reasons or sometimes, all three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>They want to be entertained</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>They want to be educated/informed</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>They want to engage</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these needs require content to drive it. Irrespective of the age or class of the consumer.</p>
<p>Today, digital content drives marketing which has largely moved online to meet consumers in their comfort zone.</p>
<p>Today’s consumer doesn’t want to be directly sold to. S/He wants to be educated/informed, entertained and engaged and if you are going to be successful at marketing anything to him/her, you have to develop content that is engaging, entertaining and/or educative/informative.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a Case Study of Digital Content in Marketing</strong>.</p>
<p>Segun needs a new laptop. He heads to google. He checks for the specifications of different laptops (probably a blog post or a video), he checks for reviews, then he checks prices and possible points of purchase. He asks for recommendations on Twitter or WhatsApp group and compares the recommendations with all the earlier information he gleaned earlier from Google. Then, he takes his decision long before he steps out of his house to make the actual purchase.</p>
<p>Segun has just been sold to – through the different types of contents that were strategically placed for him to consume to aid his buying decision.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that Google aggregates all the content on the web and delivers your specific needs using a filter called <strong>Search</strong>. In essence, the web will be a desert without content.</p>
<h5>What&#8217;s The Goal of Digital Content?</h5>
<p>In digital content creation, your goal isn’t to sell directly to prospects, your goal is to attract prospects, build trust and guide them through the buying stages.</p>
<p>All elements of Digital Marketing – Email Marketing, Search Marketing, Mobile Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Websites, Display Advertising – are driven by Content – albeit in different formats.</p>
<h5>To be successful in digital content creation, you need to look at 2 things:</h5>
<h5><strong>THE MESSAGE</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>THE MEDIUM</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The Message</strong> – What message do I want to pass across? Who is my message going to? At what stage of the buyer’s journey is this person?</p>
<p><strong>The Medium</strong> – What medium will this message be on? What format will attract the target audience?</p>
<h5><strong>Here&#8217;s an example</strong></h5>
<p>If your target audience is a 17-year-old chap, you have no business creating an E-book for him to download on your website. He will never read it. Instead, you are better off reaching him with a one-minute video on Snapchat.  <strong>Message + Medium</strong></p>
<h5>Digital Content Formats</h5>
<p>Content can be presented in various formats:</p>
<p>Videos</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Infographics</p>
<p>Blog Posts</p>
<p>E-Books/Playbooks/Guides</p>
<p>Articles</p>
<p>White papers</p>
<p>Podcasts/Webcasts</p>
<p>Templates</p>
<p>Research Reports</p>
<p>Games e.t.c</p>
<h5>And there Is a new kid on the block &#8211;  Online Experience</h5>
<p>Online experience uses a mix of different formats to tell a story. Instead of just seeing static text on the screen for an article or perhaps an e-book, it can use a mix of Text, Videos, Infographics and images to tell a complete story.</p>
<h5>Here Are Some Online Experience Examples:</h5>
<p><a href="http://lnkd.in/TPlanExperience">http://lnkd.in/TPlanExperience</a></p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/NewMediaMessage">http://bit.ly/NewMediaMessage</a></p>
<p><a href="http://lnkd.in/SMSessions">http://lnkd.in/SMSessions</a> .</p>
<p>Facebook Carousel Ad is another good example of Online Experience</p>
<h5>Measuring The Effectiveness of Digital Content</h5>
<p>Now that you’ve got your message and medium right, your content has got to be <strong>measured</strong>.</p>
<p>You can use the following metrics:</p>
<p><strong>Lead Generation</strong> – How much data was the content able to bring in (Data Capture) – especially for B2B businesses</p>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong> – How much people engaged with the content by sharing, commenting etc. – Engagement helps top of mind awareness and word of mouth recommendation</p>
<p><strong>Sales</strong> – How much sales was the content able to influence? Businesses need to make sales. The numbers are important.</p>
<p>In some cases, one content may not be able to satisfy all three measurement criteria but nonetheless, it should satisfy at least one criteria – in line with the marketing objectives.</p>
<h5>Looking into the future</h5>
<p>All marketing professionals of today and indeed the future will need to be able to generate content. Gone are the days when you say, &#8220;I am not a copywriter&#8221;. Content creation is an important skill in marketing.</p>
<p>Your Facebook post, tweet, Instagram post, Whatsapp chat etc., are all content. You only need to be more purposeful when creating marketing content.</p>
<p>To help hone your content skill, I recommend the book &#8211; <a href="http://annhandley.com/everybodywrites/"><strong>Everybody Writes by Ann Handley</strong></a></p>
